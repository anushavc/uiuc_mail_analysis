students living in university residence halls learn the locations of emergency exits in the buildings and are provided guidance about the direction they should travel when exiting each facility for a shortterm building evacuation residents are not told in advance about the designated locations for longterm evacuations because those decisions are affected by time of day location of the building being evacuated the availability of the various designated emergency gathering locations on campus and other factors such as the location and nature of the threat in these cases university housing staff andor first responders on scene will communicate information to students regarding the developing situation or any evacuation status changes the purpose of evacuation drills is to prepare

identify deficient equipment so that repairs can be made immediately recommendations for improvements are also submitted to the appropriate departmentsoffices for consideration students who reside in university residence halls receive information about evacuation and shelterinplace procedures during their first floor meetings and during other educational sessions they can participate in throughout the year university housing staff members are trained in these procedures as well and act as an ongoing resource for the students living in residential facilities shelterinplace procedures what it means to shelterinplace there may be emergencies that arise that do not afford individuals the opportunity to safety evacuate during these types of emergency situations shelteringinplace may be necessary shelteringinplace means to stay inside a known safe area to avoid adverse conditions in an exterior environment examples of emergencies where the shelterinplace option may be necessary andor preferred include severe weather tornado or an active shooter situation this may also include a fire emergency for persons with disabilities that are not able to leave the building on their own or if the elevator is recalled during a fire basic shelterinplace guidance if an incident occurs that does not present a safe opportunity to evacuate find an immediate place of safety and stay there until it is safe to come out this may include locking the doors or barricading the ingressegress points of the area you are occupying it may also include covering the windows to decrease visibility of the occupied area if an incident occurs where a shelterinplace option is not possible leave the area immediately following the evacuation procedures for your building follow the directions of police andor fire personnel if they are on scene of the incident how you will know to shelterinplace a shelterinplace notification may come from several sources including the university of illinois police department via the illinialert emergency notification system the office of public affairs other university employees or other authorities utilizing the universitys emergency communications tools how to shelter inplace if an incident occurs where shelteringinplace is the best option follow these steps unless instructed otherwise by emergency personnel these steps should only be followed if safe to do so once aware of the emergency seek or remain in a location deemed safe from the affected area once within a safe area attempt to secure the space in whatever reasonable manner is applicable stay in the area of safety and remain quiet unless making noise would be beneficial to your safety ie rescue or recovery stay away from objects which may lead to an injury do not leave the area of safety

20111101094858-004657,dear faculty and staff as we approach the second half of the general assemblys annual fall veto session were keeping a close eye on issues of concern to the university of illinois one of those issues is public pension funding you may be seeing ads in the media promoting senate bill legislation that proposes changes in pension funding for current employees that we believe would adversely affect the university and the state as i communicated with you last spring i testified against this bill and it was not moved forward for action many legislators were concerned by the potential adverse consequences of the bill which i and others brought to their attention we continue to press for a solution to the states pension funding concerns that doesnt unjustly place the entire burden on the backs of our hardworking employees as part of this effort i share with you the text of an oped i submitted to the chicago suntimes which was published this past sunday it follows my sign off i encourage you to contact your legislators using your own personal email and resources ie nonuniversity to assert the importance of a fair solution and the problematic aspects of sb ill continue to keep you updated as the issue moves forward sincerely mike michael j hogan president university of illinois oped printed in the sunday october edition of the chicago sun times cutting pensions would lead to u of i brain drain by michael j hogan its easy to understand the law of unintended consequences the unanticipated and sometimes perverse effects of actions sometimes government actions that were ostensibly intended to provide a public good examples of this principle abound but one that is often noted these days has to do with senate bill now under discussion in springfield to fund the states pension obligations to public employees leaders in illinois public higher education worry that the proposed solution could have unintended consequences of substantial proportions their employees many ineligible for social security would have to accept diminished benefits or ante up significantly more to maintain the benefits they were promised the likely effect of senate bill in its current form will be a brain drain from these public universities and their surrounding communities the university of illinois is one of the largest and most productive employers in the state twenty percent of our workforce is pension eligible and that includes some of our most distinguished faculty physicians and staff many of whom would leave if onerous changes are made in the pension plan make no mistake about it these outstanding and civicminded employees have choices in a competitive market place not bound by geography those who leave may take their externally funded research projects worth millions of dollars with them and take their pension too replacing these employees with comparable talent will be difficult so long as other universities are offering better benefits such an exodus would devastate our ability to meet the u of is teaching research public service and health care missions and would slam the brakes on what has consistently been a vibrant economic engine for this great state among the top teaching and research universities in the world the u of i and its three campuses directly and indirectly generates more than jobs and more than billion in economic impact for illinois a return of for every that the state invests in the u of i we are the place that pioneered transistors led lighting and mri technology we are the place that educated the founders of youtube paypal and the nfl none of this happens without great people entrepreneurial scientists pushing the boundaries of knowledge awardwinning authors artists and teachers skilled health care professionals other universities in other states are hungry for this talent we must work hard to retain them but the proposed pension funding legislation will make it difficult to do that and to recruit other highly professional faculty and staff it will damage the public university system in illinois and in so doing damage the state as well as we contemplate the states strategic advantages how does it help in the long term to reduce funding for higher education including two public tier one research campuses and provide substantially less compensation to its talented workforce we know that a solution to the pension problem is urgently needed and we are willing to contribute our fair share to an equitable solution but it needs to be based on the principles of equity and shared sacrifice to which we can all contribute without doing great damage to the educational institutions central to the well being of our students and to the states place in a knowledgebased economy i urge legislators to consider the interests of our employees the impact of their departure and the threat that weakened public universities pose to the future of the state the potential consequences are far too great to ignore michael j hogan is president of the university of illinois,senate bill public pension funding,01,2011,Nov,Tuesday

20110527094407-026766,dear colleagues as we enter the closing days of the state legislative session i thought it important to give you an update about an issue i know many of you are following closely pension funding legislation let me begin by saying that weve worked very hard to share both our concerns about this bill and our interest in working with legislators to find solutions to the many challenges that the state of illinois faces this spirit of candor about the adverse effects of the pension funding bill being considered alongside recognition that the general assembly is working very hard on extremely challenging problems is i think a fair balance to strike yet the current legislation under consideration places the burden of pension funding on the backs of our employees who have made their contributions to the system for many years in good faith i dont see this as a fair and balanced solution to this challenge before the state on thursday we were disappointed when the house committee on pensions and personnel voted to advance a bill on pension funding to the house floor that would have negative consequences for our employees i was invited to testify thursday morning prior to the committee vote and did so as the only public university president at the hearing you can find my testimony at there were other constituencies that joined us in testifying against the bill despite the outcome we were heartened by comments from some committee members that called attention to the serious negative consequences of the legislation especially concerns related to the retention and recruitment of our exceptionally talented state employees a point i highlighted in my testimony in the coming day or so the bill will be debated on the house floor should the bill advance through the house the next step will entail consideration in the senate even if it proceeds through the senate and is signed into law there will be constitutional challenges i want to assure you that we will continue to work hard to make the case that it is not in the states best interest to risk its most precious resource our highly accomplished faculty and staff at one of the worlds best institutions the university of illinois i hope that you too are weighing in with your own personal opinions about this legislation as citizens of the great state of illinois please note that in doing so state law does not allow you to use your university of illinois email stationery or telephone instead you must use your personal communication resources as a citizen of the state let me close by noting how proud i was to represent the university of illinois on thursday as i am each and every day what is perhaps most gratifying is the acknowledgment from others in the halls of our state capitol regarding how important the university is how important you are to the future of the state sincerely mike michael j hogan president university of illinois,legislative testimony update,27,2011,May,Friday

20110512091638-011177,dear colleagues as the academic year winds down id like to share my appreciation with you and update you on the important work were doing together as our commencements conclude its a time of celebration and hope yet a bittersweet moment as we watch our graduates leave us for wonderful careers and great futures all over the world our graduates are among those most sought by employers and among those who give the most back to their communities im proud of each of them and of the dedicated faculty and staff who have prepared them for their lives ahead we have many other successes to celebrate too our campuses faculty staff and students continue to garner national and international acclaim for their accomplishments our foundation is completing its successful brilliant futures campaign which pledges more than billion in new support to our university our research portfolio is growing and more students than ever are applying for admission demonstrating again the high regard for the university of illinois we should never lose sight of the tremendous accomplishments of our faculty staff and students the innovative discoveries and many contributions they make to a better future for people all over the world we are strong and resilient the economic crisis we face today will pass and we will emerge better than ever yet we do need to recognize the challenges still ahead when i visit with faculty and staff i hear concerns about pension and benefits i continue to communicate with leadership in the general assembly and to our legislators how important it is for the state to fulfill its commitment to our employees on the pension front weve also been in direct contact with the director of the illinois department of healthcare and family services on attempts to eliminate health alliance as a healthcare option for our current employees and retirees see weve communicated that thousands of university employees and retirees would be negatively affected by such an action and theres good reason to believe that costs would actually increase for the state our legislators are listening and were gaining more support for our position with every passing day another area is procurement where weve taken a lead role in preparing a document explaining the extensive costs of new regulatory requirements to universities and the state in terms of lost contracts declining competitiveness and the loss of precious time and effort we recognize the importance of fair legal and ethical procurement practices but many of the new regulatory burdens cost the state millions in lost opportunities for the best possible value and service and are undermining participation by vendors especially small businesses and minorityowned firms weve presented compelling evidence and our legislators are interested in working with us on solutions another concern involves position exemption authority from the state universities civil service system under which the university determines if a position is classified as civil service or academic professional within criteria set forth by state statute weve made some mistakes which were resolved to correct and avoid in the future a bill introduced in the senate sb however would remove this authority and undermine our ability to make appointments in response to rapidly arising academic and research needs the bill is now in the house and we are working closely with representatives to communicate the unique employment situation at the university and the importance of retaining our positionexemption authority there are other issues were weighing in on including the concealed carry legislation hb weve helped draft amendments that can exempt parts of our campuses from the carrying of concealed weapons should this legislation pass another is the illinois dream act sb this bill will provide greater support to our undocumented students as we know students admitted to the university of illinois whether documented or undocumented are among the nations brightest and like all of our graduates they go on to stellar careers and become tax paying citizens and contributors to our economy and society its important for us as a nation of immigrants to ensure that the most precious resources our state has bright minds are not closed off from reaching their potential ive had many opportunities to speak directly with governor pat quinn house speaker michael madigan and senate president john cullerton on these and other issues im grateful that they take our views seriously and keep us apprised of developments in springfield several legislators have been very supportive as well and were grateful for their help we also appreciate the efforts of the alumni associations illinois connection which organized an impressive lobby day at the state capitol to apprise legislators of the universitys needs theyve also supported us by encouraging their members to write legislators and members of our congressional delegation to support the university were fortunate to have such loyal and committed partners additionally our governmental relations team is also hard at work on these issues with legislators in their offices and in the halls of the state capitol theyre working around the clock for us and deserve our thanks for their efforts our budget remains a concern earlier i reported on my testimony before the appropriations committees which went well its clear from these and other conversations that legislators recognize the tremendous value of university of illinois to the state theyre proud of the u of i and impressed by our efforts to streamline the universitys business functions seek new revenues improve services increase efficiencies and generate millions in costsavings while protecting our academic core efforts such as the administrative review restructuring arr programs are helping us achieve this goal while also making a favorable impression on our legislators with assistance from springfield and careful planning on our part weve avoided furloughs this year and hope to offer a salary program for all eligible faculty and staff in the coming fiscal year the board of trustees has directed us to continue the arr efforts and accelerate them in this continued challenging fiscal environment the arr steering committee which includes the university senates conference chair the chancellors and the cfo will continue its work to move these efforts forward i appreciate the involvement of many of you in this work and the support youre expressing for those leading these efforts i know the campuses are engaging in their own reviews and assessments and many of you are participating in those efforts please know how grateful i am for your hard work the decisions we make about implementing arr and campus initiatives are informed by the insights that you bring to these discussions yet its important to clarify some misconceptions about the changes weve made for instance one colleague shared concerns with me that our consolidation of some of our human resources functions removed oversight of faculty recruitment promotion and tenure from the campuses this is not the case faculty review procedures remain within the purview of the campus others have expressed alarm upon hearing incorrectly that changes in administering campus information technology it infrastructure mean that it budgets and operations at all levels of the campuses would be eliminated in fact the majority of it delivery occurs at the college and department levels and that will continue to be the case further campus chief information officers cios are retaining their portfolios and are in regular communication with administrators on the campuses the major change for campus cios is that they will play a bigger role in universitywide decisions through their reporting line to the universitys executive cio the administrative changes were making at the infrastructure level will support and improve services just as they will support our academic and research policies rather than determine those policies change can be difficult but as one of the worlds great centers of research and innovation we live with and explore change every day as many of you have shared with me change is embedded in our research teaching and service as we seek ongoing improvement in everything we do and the world in which we live i appreciate your forwardlooking vision and willingness to work on the changes were currently making and those still ahead these changes will allow us to save millions to protect and enhance our core academic priorities during these challenging times and to invest in our students faculty and staff i look forward to continuing to work with you as we seek improvements and find solutions to the challenges we face im grateful that many of you have accepted invitations to serve on advisory groups as we develop governance plans to improve in areas like hr and it for example michael hites continues to consult with campus and collegiate it leaders and a faculty advisory group recommended by the university senates conference hes working closely with them and with provosts and chancellors to establish it governance plans likewise maureen parks continues to consult with campus hr leaders and larry schook has formed a faculty advisory committee

20110407120826-006857,april dear colleagues and friends of the university of illinois i want to take this opportunity to share with you my perspective on the states ongoing budget and pension crises and their possible impact on the university in the coming fiscal year and beyond the states budget situation remains grim with a significant operating deficit that includes a backlog of unpaid bills expected to approach billion by the end of this fiscal year as of april the state owes the university over million in appropriation and financial aid payments for this fiscal year the governor proposed a fiscal year operating budget that would maintain funding for public universities at this years level with a million increase proposed in financial aid for eligible students the universitys share of this proposal would be a million general revenue fund appropriation and approximately million in financial aid for our students however based on comments at both the senate and house higher education appropriations hearings we have been forewarned to prepare for a significant reduction in our fiscal appropriation in those hearings i stressed the value of higher education in general the universitys key role in generating tangible results for our students and the state and the need for sustained state support to assure our continued success see the url below for my testimony this week before the house appropriations committee two months are remaining in the states legislative session and we must realistically prepare for a reduction in the universitys fiscal appropriation the university is no longer protected by federal stimulus stabilization operating grant agreements that prohibited reductions in state operating appropriations below certain levels legislative leadership has indicated that a reduction of the governors operating budget proposal of as much as billion is under consideration it is too early to predict the outcome of these budget deliberations and the ultimate impact on the university but the campuses and ua have been actively planning for various scenarios i am acutely aware that our faculty and staff have not had a general compensation increase since august avoiding another round of furlough days remains one of my top priorities for fiscal as is a meaningful compensation adjustment while we will follow closely the fiscal appropriation budget legislation and will push for maximum funding i am also wary of the pension and healthcare adjustments that are being discussed in springfield and the profound impact these adjustments would have on our faculty and staff the state university retirement system surs funding level has dropped to a dangerously low assetstolongtermliability ratio of as of june and surs is paying out substantially more in benefits than it takes in contributions besides the statutory pension reforms benefit accruals retirement age for new employees that became effective january there is now some public discussion in the media and by legislators of extending these pension reforms to current university employees on a prospective basis as well as possibly increasing employee pension contributions or offering alternate defined contribution retirement plans as i said at this weeks meeting of the house appropriations committee i believe the state should meet its promises to our faculty and staff the majority of whom do not qualify for social security to fund pension benefits earned lawmakers are also examining other benefit changes that would affect university employees and retirees including increasing employee retiree and university contributions to health insurance eliminating dependent tuition waivers for university employees taxing benefit payments and other actions while it is clear there continues to be a state budget crisis in illinois it is not clear what priorities will be set or actions taken to address it i am committed to achieving the best outcome possible for our faculty and staff and in the ensuing seven weeks i will work diligently with our governmental relations staff and elected officials in springfield toward that goal like you i believe the state should do everything in its power to fully fund and honor its commitments but the states budget and pension funding problems are foreboding and i want you to be fully informed on these issues to that end a pension information forum is being held on each campus next week to brief you on current proposed legislation that may affect your benefits on april th noon the forum will be held at the alice campbell alumni center ballroom on the urbanachampaign campus another session will be held on april th at pm in conference rooms c d of the public affairs center on our springfield campus the session on our chicago campus will be held on april th at pm at the uic forum i urge you to attend one of these sessions to be fully briefed on the issues a website is available containing the proposed benefit bills with links to reports and summaries which you can use as an additional information resource we are coordinating with other state public universities so that we can speak with one voice with a common goal to preserve earned benefits we are living with great uncertainty but by working together we can navigate passage through these extremely difficult times and emerge with our best days still ahead as i noted in my testimony before legislative committees last month and this month the university of illinois is a tremendous resource for the state our faculty staff and students continue to generate discoveries that enrich peoples lives and add to the social cultural and economic wellbeing of the state im deeply proud of the work you do and appreciative of your commitment to our great university sincerely mike michael j hogan president university of illinois,financial update,07,2011,Apr,Thursday

20110304103022-006064,dear colleagues on wednesday i had an opportunity to testify before the state senate appropriations ii committee it was a great forum for me to articulate the value proposition as one senator put it of the states investment in the university of illinois i was able to share our many outstanding accomplishments including the university of illinois produces about billion per year in direct and indirect economic impact on the illinois economy a return of more than for every the state invests through its annual appropriation to the university university of illinois operations directly and indirectly generate more than jobs in the state annually the annual activity of our university creates more than billion in future tax revenue to the state resulting in a net annual gain to the state of about million the vast health sciences complex on our chicago campus educates a significant number of health care professionals practicing in illinois and provides stateoftheart care through more than patient visits each year our springfield campus among the best public liberal arts universities in the midwest has garnered national recognition for its advances in online education and blended learning graduates of the university of illinois at urbanachampaign have the highest median midcareer salary among graduates of all big ten universities and the

the combined federal research funding across our campuses puts us in the top five among us public research universities the wages and salaries of our alumni contribute about billion annually to the state economy and about jobs the senators were very impressed by all our contributions to the state the exchange also gave me an opportunity to highlight the distinctive missions and exceptional performance of each of our campuses this resonated positively with the senators at the same time they articulated as they must the states profound longterm budget crisis their questions covered a wide range of subjects from faculty and staff salaries to tuition waivers to academic programs and administrative operations i aggressively defended our policies particularly on salaries and graduate tuition waivers i explained that among other things appropriate compensation adjustments are one of my highest priorities of course they wanted to know what were doing to help ourselves and how we might replace lost positions and increase salaries when there is no additional support for either in the governors fiscal budget proposal that gave me an opportunity to explain we are making progress on the administrative review restructuring arr reforms i reported our efforts to streamline business functions across the university with the expectation of building over three years annual savings of million or more funds we must reallocate to manage any future cuts in state support avoid furlough days make compensation adjustments and replenish some of the faculty and staff positions we have lost i also had an opportunity to explain how the reforms implemented thus far have already saved over million in the first half of the current fiscal year and we expect another million by july these savings come at a minimum net cost to the university as weve reconfigured four of five positions rather than creating entirely new ones to implement the reforms we just announced the appointment of dr larry schook as interim vice president for research the vpresearch role takes on the portfolio of the former vice president for technology and economic development position along with the added responsibility of advancing our research enterprise across the three campuses and in state and federal arenas also weve expanded the portfolios of three existing and highly experienced administrators steve veazie wholl add oversight of collective bargaining across our campuses to his responsibilities as deputy university counsel is taking on the added title of executive director of labor and employee relations maureen parks as executive director for human resources will add to her responsibilities oversight across our campuses of hr services and processes involving civil service and academic professionals whose work doesnt entail a direct academic role and michael hites wholl work with campus chief information officers cios as the universitys executive cio to enhance enterprise it services and infrastructure delivered on all our campuses finally we added just one new position an interim vice president for health affairs which will be supported by clinical revenues weve appointed dr joe skip garcia to this position and charged him with enhancing our clinical healthcare mission which has the potential to realize substantial new revenues and savings while improving education and research opportunities and enhancing service to the hundreds of thousands of patients we serve ive heard that some might not be aware of these changes or are confused about how theyre being made the new cost is nominal because as noted above weve reconfigured existing positions rather than adding new ones except for the vphealth affairs we expect these changes to drive the reforms that will produce the plus million in savings that our estimates indicate we can achieve most important these changes will improve the financial circumstances for each campus enabling each to remain competitive and enhance its performance and its distinctive mission additionally our effectiveness in these costsavings efforts will inform the boards tuition decision under the policy it adopted at the january board meeting in the midst of the states profound budget problems and our efforts to deal with the implications for our great university im proud that so many of you are working collaboratively on these reforms are focusing on the big picture and are recognizing the opportunity for positive transformation which improves services and saves precious resources as ive been doing ill continue to keep you informed of our legislative work and our progress on arr reforms since joining our great university last july ive spent hundreds of hours on more than meetings with campus senates and their leaders student groups deans department chairs collective bargaining unit leaders academic professionals and other constituencies comprising our shared governance system some may wish i could spend more time with them and ill continue to do my best to visit with you these consultations have been very beneficial and at the urging of faculty staff and students weve made many changes to proposals under consideration before i arrived and shortly thereafter these include taking the proposal to combine the campus chancellor and provost positions off the table reversing the decision to combine the vp academic affairs with the vpted keeping the provost title for vice chancellors of academic affairs changing the vpresearch ted title to vpresearch and ensuring that the vphealth affairs description includes alignment of the clinical enterprise with our academic and research missions all these adjustments arose from my consultations with so many of you im grateful for your good advice and welcome it as we continue to move forward none of this would have been possible without your support and the help of chancellors vice presidents and others on the arr steering committee also im grateful for the participation of president emeritus stan ikenberry who launched the arr efforts before i arrived and remains a close friend and advisor as my session wednesday with the committee of the state senate demonstrated we have a great story to tell one that impresses our senators and the people of our state i urge you all to keep telling it as i will our story is one of sustained success and accomplishment even in very challenging times leaders throughout the state and nation are looking to the university of illinois to bring the exceptional talents of our faculty staff and students to bear on the pressing issues of our time i couldnt be more proud of how we are rising to these challenges and of the tremendous progress we are making together sincerely mike

20110227100226-005533,dear colleagues thank you for your continued hard work and support as we navigate a variety of challenging issues its a busy time in springfield and at university and im hearing from many of you about these challenges i look forward to continuing to visit with you but in the meantime let me address questions ive been hearing q what can you tell us about pension reform a pension reform is troubling because it could negatively affect our current employees and compromise recruitment efforts we hope the state will meet commitments its made to our employees and our governmental relations staff is working hard on this issue in springfield yet we must remember that pension issues are one part of larger budget issues in the state we must try to advance our interests in this area without damaging our interests in other areas important to the university q what is the state budget situation a the passage of new tax legislation promises to reduce the states structural deficit and offers a partial solution to our serious budget problems still the state faces billions in unpaid bills eliminating this deficit may take a combination of borrowing new revenues and reduced expenditures which may include reductions in support for the university currently the state owes the university almost million of its fy operating budget and map student financial aid funding even though were nearly eight months into the current fiscal year dealing with this may require the state to borrow some additional money as part of a debt restructuring plan which may or may not win legislative support before the end of the fiscal year it is clear that the state has longterm structural fiscal problems to deal with as well as the short term cash crisis and we are not out of the woods yet we must continue to monitor resources diligently and manage state allocations as carefully as possible q why are we trimming our budgets further when the governors budget doesnt decrease our appropriation a were grateful to the governor for not proposing further cuts to our budget in his recent address still we know that flat funding doesnt account for cost increases or inflation in our costs and it doesnt support compensation adjustments or replacement of lost faculty and staff we must pay our bills including paying faculty and staff even if the state doesnt enact a debt restructuring plan and state payments to us continue to lag also i promised that i would not support furloughs im glad that ive kept that promise and careful budget oversight will help us avoid furloughs next year as well depending on state action im hopeful that well be able to provide our faculty and staff with the first compensation adjustment weve had since august this remains one of my highest priorities in short our budget constraints safeguard us against further delays in state payments or rescissions this year and next buffer us against potential reductions in our state appropriation or other adjustments to our budget help us avoid furlough days and i hope cover costs of a compensation program q what about other revenues to replace state funding a first our hardworking faculty and staff continue to do more with less and generate new revenues our interim vp for research larry schook will work with colleagues to drive our research numbers higher were also appointing a director of federal relations in washington dc who will further expand our federal funding opportunities also dr schook will work in washington springfield and through our corporate partnerships to open new avenues for revenue opportunities and were coming to the end of a very successful capital campaign and expect to meet even exceed our billion brilliant futures goal this will dovetail with a new initiative to raise millions for new scholarships particularly needbased scholarships at the same time were exploring new and more successful ways to organize our fundraising operations the goal of this effort will be to obtain a much better return on our investment finally tuition is now our largest and most reliable revenue source to our boards credit trustees want to make it more predictable for our students and their families by tying tuition increases to inflation rates state appropriations and the success of our efforts to reduce administrative costs achieving a proper balance between these revenue sources and administrative efficiencies is the key to our longterm wellbeing q where are we with the administrative review restructuring arr report and the efficiencies it recommends a under the leadership of stan ikenberry and avijit ghosh were making great progress were actively implementing the arr reforms in many areas including procurement capital projects human resources and information technology more work will be ongoing weve already realized about million in recurring annual administrative costs and expect that number to about double by the end of this fiscal year these reforms are overseen by a steering committee which includes the chancellors vice presidents and the chair of our university senates conference in each area we also benefit from the advice of implementation committees that include campuslevel experts let me take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation for the help and good work of all of the people involved even though at times it entails changes that can be difficult to make q how are we covering costs of new administrative positions and how does this square with reducing administrative overhead a the new cost for these positions is nominal the vp for health affairs is covered by clinical revenues not new general fund costs the cost for the vpresearch is not new this is a retitling of the existing vp for technology and economic development our new executive director of human resources and executive chief information officer are not new hires theyre internal promotions we expect all these positions to either generate new revenues or further costreductions whats involved is not additional cost but rather reallocation of resources to generate more revenue reduce costs and improve the services we provide for our faculty staff and students this is what our university has always done particularly when facing financial stress to remain great and improve its competitive position q what is the status of the searches for a new vice president chancellor on our springfield and urbanachampaign campuses a thanks to the outstanding work of the search advisory committees these searches are going very well let me express my gratitude to both committees chaired by dr tihfen ting springfield and dr doug beck urbanachampaign the search for at springfield is in its final stages as the committee has put forth its finalists the search advisory committee for the vpchancellor at uiuc formed in december already posted the position description and is receiving nominations i want to personally extend my gratitude to the committee members who are dedicating so much time and effort to these important searches q what are we doing about the new procurement reform law a nothing has been more aggravating to all of us who must deal with the onerous regulatory processes embedded in this policy i know that all of us as public employees expect to comply with reasonable systems of accountability but we believe there should be a proper balance between accountability and regulation that undermines our effectiveness i want to thank our university ethics officer donna mcneely and our office of business and financial services for their ongoing efforts to secure reasonable adjustments to how this new procurement law is interpreted and applied i also want to thank the various state agencies which have made these adjustments at the same time our office of governmental relations is working tirelessly to call the attention of these same officials as well as legislators in springfield to the need for further adjustments to the policy i hope these answers to the questions and concerns im hearing is informative rest assured that others will follow as i try to keep you abreast of the progress we are making on these and the other issues with which were dealing thank you for your time and consideration mostly thank you for all you do each day to help us through these challenging times sincerely mike michael j hogan president university of illinois,university update,27,2011,Feb,Sunday

20100728170819-027531,to illinois faculty from sally jackson chief information officer and associate provost and panit lisy executive director cites re dramatic communications technology changes to come dear colleagues communication technology has changed dramatically over the past quartercentury and especially over the past few years campus now has an opportunity to rethink how we deliver common it services related to human communication including email calendaring telephone service voice mail conferencing and instant messaging currently we have multiple email and calendaring platforms hosted by central it departments and by colleges and business units each form of communication has different technical underpinnings and for any one form there may be multiple providers of the service we can do much better than this leveraging our worldclass data network and exciting new advances in communication and collaboration tools many universities have already migrated from oldfashioned telephony to voice over internet protocol voip using special telephone switches and phone sets on the data network infrastructure cites did an extensive study of voip technologies before concluding last year that the high cost for this incremental advancement was not justifiable technology has continued to advance however and the current trend is not merely to run voice service over data infrastructure but to actually converge many different communication tools as part of a common system strongly motivated by the pressure of the current financial crisis campus it professionals have discovered a path toward massively improved communication support that is not only affordable but actually saves money as compared with what we spend now among the ways of moving forward toward a stateoftheart unified communications environment one stands out for its cost advantages to campus using microsoft software tools available under a campus agreement to all faculty staff and graduateprofessional students the purpose of this memo is to inform the campus that cites is moving forward with implementation of a microsoftbased solution to unified communications acting on a consensus among campus it leaders and in accordance with recommendations of the stewarding excellence project team assigned to review itillinois initiatives this one new service will replace many existing services integrating phone voice mail email calendaring instant messaging and conferencing the resulting flexibility makes it possible for people to choose how they want to receive communications eg voice mail messages can be accessed through email and to specify how available they want to be to incoming communications eg during a meeting they might want to receive no messages or only certain types of messages or while traveling they might have calls to their office phone routed to their mobile phone dramatic harddollar cost savings result from this move through reduction and gradual elimination of our legacy voice system by we expect to reduce the real cost of human communication services to the campus by yearlywhile leaping forward to a much richer communication and collaboration environment this is a gamechanger for voice service but there are some downsides to go along with the considerable upsides the most important downside is that in unifying all of these services we become slightly more vulnerable to interruptions of all services at once traditional voice service operates at a standard of reliability known in the industry as five nines this means that of the time when you pick up the phone you get a dial tone by supporting all communication services on a common infrastructure and common software application we risk losing voice service whenever we experience a network outagestill very uncommon but not yet a fivenines technology we will also experience transitional costs as people get used to the new capabilities of unified communications and adapt to new devices our technical staff and other colleagues are already thinking about how to minimize the risks and the transitional costs we will stop pressing forward if at any point we see that the downsides are unmanageable because of the size of savings we expect to receive from this and the exigency of our financial situation we are moving forward with less deliberation than a change of this magnitude would normally warrant what we can tell you is that this has been thoroughly studied by a small but diverse number of colleagues including it leaders from all major academic units technical experts in cites and other units and faculty members charged with reviewing unified communications as a cost reduction strategy under stewarding excellence nearly all who have actually studied this opportunity including many who started as skeptics have come to the conclusion that the benefits are worth the modest tradeoffs we assume that most others will ultimately come to the same conclusion so we are moving forward but paying close attention to any new issues that arise demos of the uc system will be available to campus starting next month in which the new capabilities that we can expect will be shown please mark your calendar for august you will receive more details about the demos soon if you are unable to make the august sessions other demos will be scheduled for this fall for further information about why this decision was made please visit the stewarding excellence website and choose itillinois for more information about the technology or the project please

20100622134003-028178,dear colleagues i am deeply grateful to the members of the administrative review and restructuring work group for their effort and commitment to the challenging task placed in front of them last november the group was ably led by dr craig bazzani and dr avijit ghosh and i wish to express my special appreciation to them and to each of the members of the work group the aim was and remains the identification of avenues to improve service while reducing costs doing that will not be easy but events of the last year and the fiscal and political landscape that lie ahead make it even more crucial than when we began the real challenge however is one of execution good ideas and recommendations are useless sitting on the shelf gathering dust alongside other wellintentioned efforts in the past the work group presents fortythree recommendations across organizational and functional areas which need more study and refinement but they also require action in may i brought to the board of trustees the work groups proposal that the positions of vice president for academic affairs and vice president for technology and economic development be consolidated and the board approved the recommendation additional steps including needed changes in the general rules await the arrival of president michael hogan in july this initial step however is intended to signal a much broader opportunity to improve functioning by reducing the number of senior executive positions at all levels reducing layers of management and capturing the synergies to improve performance another key recommendation of the work group is to craft stronger partnerships among the foundation alumni association and other externally facing university advancement and development functions this recommendation has the support of the respective boards and has never been more important and urgent given the difficult economic and political times we are experiencing we can and must capture savings in the information technology and procurement areas across the entire university examples include consolidation of data centers email and calendaring services and a centrallyled procurement model which maximizes strategic purchases for highusage supplies and services as the work group observed talented dedicated people are the universitys most precious asset still there is no one point in the university at which human resource policies are monitored and managed the consequence is an outdated ruledriven system of personnel policies and decisions we must be smarter and do better while the work group did not hire outside consultants as we move into the implementation phase such assistance may be necessary the need for improved human resource policies and systems presents a case in point a parallel effort of academic program review has been occurring on each campus the chancellors are leading a review of academic priorities structures processes and policies i make special note of these efforts since academic transformation may be even more challenging than the administrative reform but it carries even greater longterm significance none of these steps will be easy change will not occur overnight but it must occur promptly the university must achieve the savings and improvements now as i leave the presidency president hogan has asked me to accept personal responsibility for guiding these efforts and i have agreed to do so i will form a small implementation team to facilitate review and consultation and will advise president hogan and the chancellors regarding next steps i will also meet with the university senates conference and others including the board of trustees to seek their support and advice above all the university must control its destiny and safeguard its future each of us can and must contribute to this transformation the work groups report is posted at your ideas and suggestions are needed and welcome it has been my privilege to serve as your president for the past six months more than you will ever know i thank you for your confidence and support i look forward to being your colleague in the months and years ahead for all you contribute to the university of illinois i am deeply grateful stanley o ikenberry president,adm review and restructuring arr final report,23,2010,Jun,Wednesday

20100105072849-027104,january dear colleagues and friends of the university of illinois the university of illinois is a yearold institution that has weathered every challenge and ultimately thrived we will continue to thrive but we now face a cash crisis triggered by the states financial situation which is grim and worsening the state budget is out of balance with a backlog of unpaid bills nearing billion and shortterm borrowing covering roughly a comparable amount the states credit rating has been recently downgraded and among the states only california is worse the consequences for our university and others in this state are unprecedented and worsening in our case the university of illinois has received only of this years state appropriation since the first of july the shortfall is more than million and mounting at some point we will be unable to meet payroll and complete the academic year unless there are significant payments from the state as promised my hope is that the governor leaders and members of the general assembly will come together immediately to address the states escalating financial crisis as they do so they will have our full support and the support of the people of illinois who understand the tragic consequences of inaction until we see signs of this financial crisis lifting we must implement the following short term measures to conserve cash earlier in the fiscal year we set aside million in reserves and in november we directed units to reduce expenditures by to yield an additional million unfortunately we now need to use all of this million to address our immediate cash crisis while addressing only a fraction of our overall shortfall in state payments this action is essential to help sustain the universitys payroll we have struggled this year to avoid furloughs for faculty and staff but that is simply no longer possible personnel expenses represent the majority of our budget i am hereby directing the chancellors deans and other university administrators to join me in taking a total of ten furlough days or two days per month beginning in february and through the pay period ending on june additionally i am directing faculty members and academic professional staff to take a total of four furlough days beginning in february and through the pay period ending on may or essentially one day per month a furlough is a temporary leave of absence without pay and this measure will contribute million exceptions to furlough day policies are employees whose annual base salaries are or less graduate assistants and fellows employees with retirement agreements for retirement no later than august and individuals paid from grant or contract funds as of december in the case of civil service staff we will seek comparable cost reductions in accord with civil service rules and bargaining obligations the chancellors and i have reinforced an earlier directive to all academic and administrative units to avoid eliminate andor delay expenditures so as to conserve cash effective immediately an absolute freeze on all hiring or interim wage increases is declared exceptions to the hiring freeze such as hires to honor offers extended by or before the date of this letter commitments required to support specific research and contract activities eg federal stimulus research grant activities or emergency compensation adjustments must be approved by the appropriate chancellor and the president beyond the immediate cash crisis we face significant uncertainties in in anticipation of next years challenges academic and administrative support units should consider issuing notifications of non reappointment for selected individuals in employee classes whose terms and conditions of employment require advance notice of termination a work group to recommend administrative reorganization and restructuring was appointed in midnovember this group has focused on savings in the areas of information technology purchasing and consolidation of administrative support services i have asked it to provide a preliminary report to the board of trustees and university community on january our overall goal must be to preserve the strength of our faculty and academic programs by reducing administrative costs these are difficult measures and yet they represent an incomplete list of steps we must take we need to take innovative measures not just to cut budgets but to grow revenues and reduce actual costs at the same time deans department heads chairs and faculty must strategically reassess the scope of our academic programs and search for opportunities to consolidate or cut offerings that we value but may no longer be able to afford in the process we must protect our core landgrant missions of teaching research and service including clinical care remain competitive for faculty staff and students maintain essential services but eliminate duplicate and lower priority activities consolidate and share services and resources make efficient use of facilities and take such other steps as are necessary to sustain the universitys quality and continuity of operation long term all of these steps are being taken to mitigate the negative impact of the states escalating financial crisis unfortunately we cannot anticipate when state leaders will act on a plan that reorders priorities and places education first makes the painful but essential cuts in state expenditures and increases state revenues essential to restore the financial integrity of this state and its institutions of higher learning as acknowledged repeatedly by many state leaders education at all levels and especially at the university of illinois is the economic engine and future of our state and its people i urge our leaders to act now with your help we will get through this difficult period determined to grow stronger and better but we will only be able to do that if like the state we make the painful but essential decisions now i thank you for your understanding and support and i welcome your counsel as we move forward stanley o ikenberry president interim more information is available at,shortterm measures to conserve cash,05,2010,Jan,Tuesday

20091109162551-009084,the geo membership has voted to authorize its strike committee to call a strike at any time the geo made a formal press release today unofficial reports indicate that the strike would begin on monday november although we continue to believe that a strike is not in the best interests of either the geo or the university we recognize the geos legal right to take a strike action our goal always has been and continues to be to provide the best possible contract within the budget constraints we face it is not news that the state of illinois and consequently the university of illinois face severe budget problems and an uncertain financial future as presidents white and ikenberry shared recently immediate challenges include the states lack of capacity to provide the funding for this fiscal year that we are to have received but have not received more serious yet is the negative effect that state budget shortfalls will have on funding appropriated for the duration of this academic year still more serious are the projected effects on the university budget for fiscal year of the disappearance of federal recovery dollars from our state budget and the further erosion of the states tax base financial planning is now focused on meeting and coping with financial stresses exceeding any the university has encountered for many many years although we have seen welcome increases in research funding and there have been successes in the advancement campaign it must be understood that funds from those sources cannot be used for ta salaries for these reasons the geos request for a nearly raise in the minimum stipend is untenable as you know other employees of the university did not receive raises this year and the states economic situation may yet require furloughs and other costsaving measures before the end of the fiscal year the university has been working very hard with the geo to reach an agreement on a new contract and we have made substantial progress we have held negotiating sessions and have reached tentative agreement on several key items for example the university and geo have agreed to a substantial increase in the health insurance fee subsidy provided by the university increasing the universitys current contribution of to in years two and three of the contract additionally we have agreed on a parental accommodation period for the birth or initial placement or adoption of a child we value the contributions graduate students make to the university and we know we are competing nationally and internationally to attract and retain the best and brightest students the total compensation package offered by the university which encompasses wages waiver of most fees the tuition waiver and a university of illinois education reflects our recognition of the value brought to the university by our excellent graduate students nearly of geo members have appointments which means they are required to work parttime hours a week for nine months each year the average salary for those employees is or an hour our commitment to our students and employees has not changed we remain committed to providing a quality education for our students and being a fair employer to all employee groups we continue to seek ways we can provide the most beneficial employment to all but we must not make concessions to the extraordinary demands of one group while respecting the universitys severe budgetary constraints in dealing with all others i remind you again that we have an obligation to our students and their families to provide the education which they have sacrificed to attain only geo members have a legal right to strike all other employees have an obligation to meet the responsibilities of their positions employees who choose not to cross a picket line must request and receive approval in advance for vacation time as always vacation approval is based on operational need a unit is not required to approve a vacation request if there are operational needs that would be unmet if the request is approved sick leave cannot be utilized to cover strikerelated absences if staff not covered by the geo contract have unapproved absences during the strike normal discpline procedures will apply as with any unioninitiated strike action geo members who elect to strike rather than meet their job obligations will not be paid for strike absences it is important to remember that a work stoppage will do nothing to improve the financial situation that constrains what the university can do in this round of negotiations and it will not change what the university can offer in these negotiations the campus remains committed to fulfilling our educational mission our students are entitled to the education they have come to illinois to receive many with substantial sacrifice by them and their families we hope assistants will respect their instructional obligations and not impair students progress in their current courses the campus will monitor the situation closely and assess options for dealing with any disruption that might occur to minimize the harm which a work stoppage would cause instructors are expected to alert students in advance about any changes in class assignments or arrangements made because of a strike the office staff in the department or college offering a specific course also will be available to respond to questions or problems that might arise in the event of a work stoppage and staff in the dean of students office also will be available at to respond to questions or concerns of students or their parents some notes on the geo negotiations are available through this link,union issues,09,2009,Nov,Monday
20091102111910-016906,to university of illinois community from president b joseph white and interim presidentdesignate stanley o ikenberry re university budget outlook and actions the university of illinois has been dealing with budget reductions and uncertainties for some time we cant wave these away like many other public and private research universities around the country we continue to confront them a deep national recession a weak illinois economy and serious state financial problems create the challenge during the past decade the university has been subject to multiple rescissions and cuts in our appropriation from the state in fiscal year the universitys state general fund appropriation was million by fiscal that amount was down to million after accounting for a million rescission and a redirection of million annually to cover part of our health care costs previously paid by the state this is a reduction of excluding inflation or in real terms the universitys net general fund appropriation from the state for the current fiscal year is million including million of federal stimulus funds as of november the university has billed the state for million of the current fiscal year appropriation we have received very little of that amount the result is significant cash flow problems that we continue to manage whether the governor and general assembly will make downward adjustments to our current budget is unknown and may not be known for several months given this possibility however we must take steps now to manage as prudently as possible at the beginning of the year the university put funds in reserve centrally in anticipation of difficult budget challenges ahead we must now make further contingency plans to sequester an additional or million of the fiscal general fund appropriation we have asked campus and university administration leaders to develop the plans guided by these principles safeguard academic and patientcare quality serve students and maintain externally funded research programs identify organizational changes and consolidations that will yield longerterm savings we do not plan furlough days before the end of the calendar year and we hope they can be avoided completely it will be necessary however for departments colleges and administrative units to manage any hiring on a critical needs by exception basis for the remainder of the fiscal year that ends next june campus and ua leaders will determine the methods for managing personnel costs while reducing overall expenditures virtually every public university in america faces similar challenges for illinois the state economy is expected to remain weak and state revenues may decline further federal stimulus funds that are an important part of the fiscal budget are not expected to recur in we face difficult choices to position the university for a genuine recovery down the road we intend for example to implement a plan to reduce administrative costs at the campus and ua levels by a total of million over the next three years other organizational and program changes across the university will be analyzed and considered we know that living with uncertainty is not easy yet it is far from clear when state policymakers will craft a plan to address the states fiscal crisis and what the implications of the plan will be for state programs and services including higher education securing a stable and high quality future for the university of illinois is our top priority and a challenge we all share we appreciate your understanding cooperation and support during these difficult times,university budget outlook and actions,03,2009,Nov,Tuesday

20090529111012-022566,may to members of the university of illinois community from b joseph white re admissions there is a story in the chicago tribune today about the admissions process at the urbanachampaign campus of the university of illinois i have several observations about this process and the tribune story that i want to share with you first and most important all admissions to the university of illinois should be based on merit there will be many inquiries and expressions of support and interest for applicants including from powerful people but it is our job to manage a meritbased system and not succumb to pressure second it is the case that we track inquiries and expressions of interest in particular applicants by key alumni political officials trustees and othersas does every highly selective institution this was the case at the university of michigan where i spent years and at georgetown university where i served on the board of directors this is good admissions management and a necessary courtesy to these individuals tracking these admissions cases does not and should not translate into inappropriate pressure for admission nor should it infer that any pressure would be tolerated third the tribune makes no assertion that unqualified individuals were admitted to the university this must always be the case in addition if we have had a problem with inappropriate pressures for admission from wellconnected people numbers from the tribune article suggest it is a small one which does not corrupt the admissions system and which we can quickly correct specifically there were about applications to the urbana campus this year about applicants were admitted using the admissions rate cited in the article the i list applicants had a admissions rate according to the tribune this translates into the admission of more applicants on the category i list admissions rate versus the standard rate the university of illinois depends on the trust of the people of illinois i think that trust is deserved to the extent we have had instances of admissions officers or others experiencing and succumbing to inappropriate pressure for admission of less qualified over more qualified candidates this is a problem that we can and will correct joe b joseph white president university of illinois,admissions,29,2009,May,Friday

20090512162240-028875,dear campus community as we approach the th commencement in illinois history this seems an excellent opportunity to reflect on where this great university is at this moment first let us pause momentarily from the ongoing sturm und drang of the global and domestic recession and celebrate commencement consider this instead on may thousands of young women and men that we have inspired provoked and taught will receive their college diplomas we are confident that they will go on to accomplish great things and have productive successful lives that will contribute to solving the great challenges of our times we are a public research university and as such students get to experience the special nature of that noble mission here at illinois this is what we do so well this is why we work so hard and this remains our greatest gift to society commencement is illinois unplugged the occasion is this institution at its roots without the usual politics and posturing this is a time when we can say without adornment that we have fulfilled that great promise of the morrill act of to educate this states bright and motivated young people and that we have ignited their curiosity and passions and channeled their boundless idealism for the betterment of the world i believe this moment is always worth celebrating as if it were the very first commencement in our long and rich history commencement also allows us an opportunity to recommit once again to an even better future for illinois there are so many wonderful snapshots when i look back on this academic year and sift through the countless meetings and speeches the casual talks with faculty staff and students the investitures and lectures or the pleasure of just walking across the quad as students rush between classes those moments confirm to me how vibrant this university is and how engaged its people are in the issues that concern our nation one snapshot in particular was the morning i sat at the krannert center for the performing arts with two of my grandchildren listening to aaron copelands lincoln portrait i thought back to my earliest memory of that piece listening to it on the mall in dc and hearing adlai stevenson recite the wonderful words that included the phrase the occasion is piled high with difficulty it struck me that those words are being used with increased frequency and decibels lately as we as a nation struggle with the recession two wars and lately even the swine flu but i would also add that the occasion this singular moment in time at illinois is rife with opportunity the reason that illinois is such a great institution with limitless opportunity and will remain as such long past our short tenure here is its people all of you reading this especially and our broad diverse offerings our palette of arts and culture science and technology krannert to ncsa if you will commencement is a time to remind ourselves of our greatness commencement should also make all of us proud to be stewards of illinois as such we must continue to be mindful that in all that we undertake excellence must be our ordinary and only standard whether in teaching in research or in service that is one of our most precious core values a value by the way controlled more by motivation than by resources last fall when the recession hit its downward stride i said that my only fear was that in responding to the crisis that we would turn away from our bold ambitions and retreat into the hard shell of average that the exigencies of the near term would keep us from engaging and formulating the unpredictable and serendipitous the cornerstones of this university in fact the opposite happened you continue to amaze you continue to follow the creative path of extraordinary you chose to move forward toward a future less bound by the present and the past while at the same time adhering to the bold values which have defined this great university our reward comes on may at assembly hall when the first graduates of the class of receive their diplomas this day too will be rife with opportunity thank you for another great year and thank you for all you do for illinois with gratitude richard herman chancellor,congratulations class of,13,2009,May,Wednesday

20081029154614-016474,dear colleagues you have recently received a message from president white on the economic outlook for all of the campuses of the university of illinois he has charged leadership of each campus with the task of designing contingency plans to cover whatever financial realities we ultimately face in light of the declining state and national economies i write to you today to assure you that thoughtful planning is under way with our campus administrators including the vice chancellors the chancellors cabinet the council of deans and directors and department heads representatives of the faculty staff and students will also be involved through the senate and other advisory bodies i have personally experienced this situation twice before once here once elsewhere and on each occasion i saw a stronger institution emerge this is possible again if the answers to the financial questions we face are grounded in sound institutional principles and values we must and will find ways to respond to our financial circumstances that build on our accomplishments of recent years allow us to continue our forward movement and protect our missions of teaching research economic development and public engagement should we face this challenge we will have to make prudent focused decisions we must examine anew what is most important to our missions and our aspirations what must be protected and where investments must still be made guided by the campus strategic plan we developed a shared vision for this institution which requires us to o assure student access to a quality education across all income levels o safeguard the quality of our faculty and the education we offer o secure the base of excellence for which we are justly knownour research activities and related engagement with the public and o preserve our capacity to selectively invest in high potential endeavors the means by which we implement these principles will need to be devised through careful collaboration under our shared governance model one thing is clear we will need to engage our collective entrepreneurial energies to seek additional sources of funding hence greater efforts to raise resources from individuals the private sector foundations and agencies must be encouraged and to that end we must continue to argue that public higher education is a social good and an essential investment in meeting societys critical needs this is not a time for retrenchment or scaling back our aspirations for the future the next several years will be challenging ones for all of us but if we manage our way wisely through this challenging time we will emerge on the other side positioned to move ahead rapidly as new funds become available i am asking each of you to be sensitive to others in this trying time and recognize that there may be members of our community who are experiencing a particularly stressful period please look at how work is accomplished within your unit and share your suggestions as to how to work smarter with greater economies mindful that personnel equipment and utilities comprise the largest components of our expenses i ask that where possible you delay creating new jobs filling vacancies or making equipment purchases and to redouble our efforts to conserve resources on campus your excellence and dedication are our most valuable resources for addressing the challenges that this period brings the campus has for a long time been a wonderful place to make a career the larger economic downturn will not and cannot be allowed to change that very truly yours richard herman chancellor,campus economic outlook,30,2008,Oct,Thursday

20080515171954-016912,dear members of the campus community in our strategic plan the university of illinois at urbanachampaign defined an ambitious strategic intent to undertake a comprehensive set of efforts focused on sustainability that strategic intent is expressed in the following paragraph from the campus plan through the illinois sustainable energy and the environment initiative we will assemble other leading universities corporations and private enterprises and government in the state to develop new technologies models and practices that will shape national policy promote responsible stewardship of resources and build the sustainable energy and the environment initiative in this initiative we will both pursue the discoveries of basic science and seek to understand the social aspects of life in a complex society focusing on key areas such as power generation and networks transportation and portable energy water supply and use and landscapes and urban architecture we will transform the campus into a learning laboratory for demonstration of sustainable technologies while we develop curricula to prepare students with skills required to tackle the challenges of a sustainable society we will position the state of illinois as a recognized leader in research education and practices to promote sustainable utilization of energy water and land at the board of trustees meeting may lawrence c eppley chair of the board of trustees stated the importance for the university of illinois to slow the increase in demand for energy reduce consumption where possible and change business and management processes in ways that take energy conservation into account he asked the president of the university and the campus chancellors to recommend a university energy policy that would position the university as a leader in the state in this area at its meeting on november the board of trustees approved a university energy policy calling on the university to assume a leadership role in illinois and beyond in achieving greater efficiency in energy production and consumption in developing renewable energy sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions further it directed that the university will expand its teaching research and public engagement programs related to energy production and conservation and alternative and renewable energy sources over the past two years the campus community students staff and faculty has fostered an impressive set of activities and programs that respond to sustainability challenges and opportunities a few examples of these efforts include achieving significant energy savings from retrocommissioning of key campus buildings students designing a rain garden to improve water management in the community and establishing in collaboration with public and private sector partners the energy biosciences institute to advance the frontiers of knowledge relating to bioenergy in february the campus became a signatory to the american college and university presidents climate commitment the campus activities and programs underway have made important strides towards achieving the strategic intent of the campus attaining the full potential of that strategic intent now requires targeted campuslevel organizational support to foster and coordinate growth of campus activities relating to sustainability therefore i am establishing two campus leadership entities the campus sustainability council and the office of sustainability these two entities will operate in an integrated fashion to provide leadership for the extensive efforts across campus focused on responding to the societal challenges associated with global climate change and its potential impacts the scope of their activities will be comprehensive encompassing not only the academic functions of education research and engagement but also operations of the campus physical infrastructure the campus sustainability council which i will chair will provide strategic direction and oversight for sustainability initiatives on campus relative to opportunities and challenges associated with sustainability the council will be responsible for fostering campus initiatives to empower tomorrows societal leaders reengineer the campus infrastructure and practices create knowledge and technology and engage with external constituents the director of the office of sustainability will serve as vice chair of the council additional members of the council will include the provost campus vice chancellors the executive director of campus facilities and services the executive director of the institute for natural sciences and sustainability as well as representatives of the environmental council the council of deans student groups and the local community the office of sustainability will provide operational leadership to campus sustainability efforts significantly enhancing communication and coordination across the relevant campus domains the office will work with colleges and other campus units eg the environmental council and student groups such as the students for environmental concerns and the student sustainability council to develop and promote opportunities for engaging faculty and students with the critical environmental social and economic issues of sustainability at this time and into the future initially comprised of a small staff focused on enhancing communications and coordination of campus activities the office of sustainability will have reporting responsibilities to the office of the vice chancellor for public engagement because of the broad scope of its activities however the office of sustainability will need to maintain strong linkages to the entire set of campus administrative units the office of sustainability has lead responsibility for implementation of the elements of the campus strategic plan involving sustainability selected specific activities of the office of sustainability include achieve the responsibilities associated with the american college and university presidents climate commitment including development of a comprehensive plan with a comprehensive inventory within one year and an institutional action plan within two years and initiation of action steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions coordinate actions to enhance campus infrastructure and policies relating to energy use and sustainability with campus academic functions facilitate curricular enhancements including incorporation of service learning opportunities in the community which better prepare students for leadership and citizenship as society responds to climate change encourage innovative research collaborations focused on creating knowledge and technologies which will better enable society to reduce emissions and achieve climate neutrality foster collaboration with external constituencies including especially our local communities to apply broadly the lessons learned from campus operations and from our knowledge creation activities provide forums by which the broad cultural social and technological dimensions of the campus intellectual capacity can engage in meaningful dialogue regarding the challenges and opportunities associated with sustainability i look forward to working with you to create a sustainable campus that will serve as a national model warm regards richard

20080207092303-007197,february to university of illinois community from president b joseph white subject resources initiative in december following discussions with the chancellors i convened a universitywide resources summit attended by leaders representing the three campuses university administration and the foundation and alumni association the summit was designed to open dialogue on how we can deliver maximum resources to the academic front lines faculty positions and salaries and financial support of our core academic missions of teaching research service and economic development this is an important initiative because while the universitys rate of total revenue growth has been quite strong over the past three years the demands on these revenues to fund utilities deferred maintenance staff growth and other areas have been substantial looking ahead we do not expect the universitys rate of revenue growth to increase significantly in the near future therefore i decided in consultation with the chancellors to launch an important new resources initiative for the university at the summit the purpose of the initiative is to focus our resources to the fullest extent possible on our core academic missions and the faculty staff and students who are integral to their success the chancellors and i have encountered widespread concerns about resource adequacy among some of our academic colleagues despite our relatively strong financial situation the resources initiative will help us address those concerns stated differently i believe that for the amount of incremental revenue we are earning each year as a university not enough of it is reaching the academic front lines the resources summit began a collective and open dialogue on these important and difficult matters in this letter i want to provide the university community with an overview of the summit and describe the next steps of the resources initiative review of the resources summit the chancellors and provosts of the three campuses and the vice presidents of finance and academic affairs assisted me in developing the list of attendees which included deans representatives of the faculty the campus senates the senates conference a student leader from each campus and senior administrators prior to the meeting the participants were provided with a case study of the universitys current resources picture including questions like these how can we reduce the growth of central costs at all levels university administration campuses collegesschools and departments are we trying to support too much university with the dollars we have how can we collectively examine the scope of academic offerings and units at each campus to improve quality and free up resources for faculty academic programs and student support how can the president and vice presidents chancellors provosts deans and faculty best collaborate to undertake this initiative in a way that will yield meaningful and constructive results chief financial officer walter knorr provided the summit participants with an overview of university revenues and expenditures the provosts provided examples of how they handle resource challenges on their campuses the deliberations of discussion groups and a summary of the summit were posted on an interactive website where the participants provided feedback that feedback included many good ideas all this information is now available at at the end of the summit i told the participants that as we strive to manage our resources more effectively i am passionately committed to strengthening the quality academic environment and reputation of the university of illinois making and encouraging fundamental change to achieve these goals next steps the summit initiated constructive dialogue necessary for change participants stressed transparency and collaboration at all levels as we move forward with resource planning this communication is part of the collaborative effort we will pursue a twopronged approach longterm and shortterm so as not to lose momentum longterm plans we will develop a fiveyear view of our resource future so we can capitalize on resource opportunities that require more than a single year to plan and execute we will develop a fiveyear projection of annual operating budgets and a fiveyear capital plan our longrange plans we will streamline our central organizations through careful planning and attrition we will be good stewards of the environment and achieve cost containment through leadership in energy production efficiency and energy conservation we will maintain high quality academic programs and avoid sprawl and mediocrity by regularly and rigorously reviewing all academic programs we will seek change in externally imposed regulatory requirements and procedures that are incompatible with cost effectiveness and the universitys mission and culture shortterm actions a number of ideas suggested at the summit can be implemented in a relatively short period of time we will ensure that every faculty member has access to proper financial support in pursuing herhis teaching research and professional development we will take immediate steps to accelerate energy conservation such as changing to more energyefficient lighting and inviting members of our community to identify and innovate ways to conserve energy we will develop service centers to support aggregations of small departments where this makes sense we will join together to reduce bureaucratic waste and resulting frustration resources steering group with the chancellors concurrence i am forming a universitywide resources steering group comprised of the three provosts and the three vice presidents to help guide the resources initiative this group will charge campuslevel working groups convened by the provosts to address issues at each campus a fourth working group will be in university administration the working groups will meet and report regularly to the steering group the steering group chancellors and i will work together to ensure that the changes will focus our resources and strengthen the quality and reputation of the university in summary the goal of the resources initiative is to operate the university in a way that delivers the most resources possible to the academic front lines dialogue is central to the success of this initiative i welcome your insights and involvement the chancellors and i will keep you updated on progress,resources initiative,08,2008,Feb,Friday

20070215150830-027937,to the campus community as we return to normal business operations on campus i would like to thank each of you for your patience and understanding as we navigate the issues raised by this storm thankfully storms of this magnitude are a rare occurrence on our campus so we have had to cancel classes only a handful of times in the past years in each of those instances the decision to cancel was based on our estimation that continuing with normal operations would have placed the lives of students faculty and staff in danger despite the forecast for snow earlier this week public works crews worked through the night attempting to keep streets and sidewalks clear enough to allow safe travel for pedestrians and motorists however when my staff and i arrived at work tuesday morning we were distressed to find that the storm had left many sidewalks completely impassable crews were struggling to handle the inches of snow and driving winds and pedestrians had to resort to walking down the middle of the street we discussed the situation and quickly determined that classes should be cancelled and services reduced that meant that all employees except those providing emergency and direct student services should be sent home that left the question of how to compensate those who were scheduled to and had already reported for duty before the announcement as well as how to compensate those who already had chosen to stay home because the decision to reduce service was made after the start of the regular work day we followed precedent in making our decisions employees who already reported for duty tuesday and were told to go home would be paid for their entire regular shift employees who were scheduled to report for work tuesday but who called in before the announcement saying they were not coming to work would be asked to use benefits or take approved leave without pay if they did not have sufficient leave to cover the missed shift employees who were scheduled to report for work tuesday before the announcement but who called in and were told by their supervisor to stay home would be paid for their entire regular shift employees who provide emergency and direct student services and who were told to report for duty despite the reduced service decision would be paid for the shifts they worked tuesday evening i made the decision that the campus still was not safe for pedestrians and motorists so i announced that classes would again be cancelled and service would remain at reduced levels because i directed employeesexcept those providing emergency and direct student servicesnot to report for duty they will be paid as if they had worked their normal schedule these employees will not be asked to use their benefit time for wednesday unless they were already scheduled to be off on an approved leave should further clarifications be necessary to address unique situations the following individuals should be contacted academic personnel questions deb stone debstoneuiucedu staff personnel questions corbin smith cjsmithuiucedu i thank each of you for your understanding throughout this difficult situation regards richard herman chancellor,snow days,15,2007,Feb,Thursday

20070109162336-018482,to members of the campus community it was brought to my attention earlier this week that threats of violence against an american indian student and hate speech directed at all american indians were posted on a prochief facebook website created by students at the university of illinois the idea that the debate over this issue could degenerate to personal attacks that threaten the physical safety and wellbeing of members of the campus community is something that all of us should find truly abhorrent the men and women who built the university of illinois at urbanachampaign over the past years have worked hard to create a place where ideas could be explored and discussed in a safe and welcoming environment actions such as those that were recommended on this facebook site really are an attack on each member of our community and that site has now been removed i do not know the motives of the students who posted the threats but i do know that their words are dangerous and racist the threats have been forwarded to the office of student conflict resolution for investigation and action the student code guarantees that members of the campus community should be able to discuss issues and express views but it does not allow speech that threatens to harm other members of the campus community as chancellor i can not and will not tolerate such violent threats the university will take all legal and disciplinary actions available in response to the threatening messages but far less extreme actions and words can traumatize and frighten those targeted as well the right of free speechno matter how thoughtless rude or dumbis a hallmark of the american system yet as future leaders and as citizens of our campus community and later as citizens of a nation and world we must engage in a far deeper dialogue about how we are to agree to disagree vigorous debate is good and it is constitutionally protectedbut debate should be based on ideas not emptyheaded slurs or vicious threats to all members of the campus community i ask that you think seriously about what you can do to help build a campus climate with zero tolerance for racism and hate everyone has a role we should expect nothing less from ourselves i invite each of you to join us at pm february in foellinger auditorium for a forum on creating a more welcoming campus environment together we must find ways to implement our shared values of respect and dignity thank you richard herman chancellor,violent threats unacceptable,09,2007,Jan,Tuesday

20070105135920-027444,happy new year i write to add my voice to the vibrant community discussion we have been having about the global campus initiative one of the u of is five strategic priorities those priorities are make urbana americas best public research university make uic one of americas best urban research universities make uis one of americas top five small public liberal arts universities enable the u of i medical center and health science colleges to meet the education research and clinical challenges of the next quarter century make the u of i a national leader in online higher education through the global campus initiative global campus gc is a largescale innovation and deserves special comment gc emerged as a need and opportunity from our universitywide strategic planning process a draft gc plan was completed in may and has been a focus since then of the universitys shared governance process now we are approaching a time of decision on january i am convening a meeting of faculty representatives identified by the senates conference as well as several deans chet gardner and members of the gc planning team our intention is to take as a starting point the draft plan and commentaries on the plan from the faculty senates and challenge ourselves to reach as much consensus as possible about gc design this will enable us to make a unified report to the board of trustees on january and to the campus senates in the weeks after we have spent considerable time and nearly a million dollars doing extensive research and planning to enable our community to make a well informed decision on whether and how to make the u of i a national leader in online education in this letter i want to address the following matters why global campus what are the controversial elements of the plan what are the risks in launching and not launching global campus why global campus the global campus initiative is driven by mission mastery and money in that order mission today percent of americans graduate from high school but only about percent from college this massive education gap is thwarting achievement of individual dreams and impairing americas competitiveness in the global economy the university of illinois mission as a landgrant institution is to bring quality education to large numbers of able and motivated illinois citizens and others we have a moral obligation to capitalize on information and communication technology much of which was developed at the u of i to extend quality education to thousands of people who dont have the personal freedom or life circumstances to spend an extended period of time on one of our three campuses online education is especially important in enabling non traditional students underrepresented minorities placebound individuals and single parents to earn a college education the typical student in online programs is employed and between the ages of and mastery the future of higher education including the residential form will be a rich mix of inperson and online learning many high school students today take online courses college students will expect and should have this option to enable them to complete their degrees in four years or less and to make education compatible with student mobility in my inaugural address i showcased jared perry who continued his uis education online while serving with his illinois national guard unit in iraq this is an option he would not have had as an urbana or uic student and this must change we must rapidly grow the university of illinois mastery of quality online education and increase our capability to offer a large number of such courses at all three campuses global campus is a means of achieving this goal money the university of illinois is in serious need of a major new revenue source that can generate a substantial surplus to help us fund competitive faculty salaries and myriad other needs of which you are aware we cannot count on increased state support for these purposes and raising tuition much beyond the rate our board has been approving could seriously threaten access and affordability success in research grants and contracts will help as will success in our upcoming fundraising campaign but without a major new source of revenue and surplus we are unlikely to be able to achieve our strategic priorities and have the brilliant future which we seek global campus is by far our best new financial prospect pro forma financial statements show an annual gc revenue surplus in five years of more than million as a matter of proportion bear in mind that for the increase in our direct appropriation from the state of illinois the first in five years was million controversial elements of the plan my reading of the commentary on global campus by the various senates suggests that there is a high level of understanding of the vision and purposes of the gc concerns seem to center on three areas the organizational form of gc currently proposed to be a limited liability corporation the role of the faculty both tenure system and supplemental and the consequences for quality future accreditation and degreegranting authority of gc these matters and others will be addressed at the consensusbuilding meeting on january we should be flexible about organization as long as the form selected is fully compatible with success of the enterprise with regard to faculty and quality tenure system faculty will have course design faculty selection and quality assurance responsibility in gc supplemental faculty will do a substantial amount of the direct teaching this is not a new or unfamiliar educational model at u of i with regard to accreditation in the first several years of gc all degree programs will be offered through urbana uic and uis while we must position gc to have the option of seeking separate accreditation and degreegranting authority at some time in the future that decision does not have to be made now campus senates will have the opportunity to weigh in on the matter when it arises and the board of trustees will exercise final authority on whether and when to seek separate accreditation of global campus risks in the thinking of the gc team and in discussion with the board faculty and students three kinds of risk have been identified in the gc initiative reputation risk value of degree risk operational and financial risk if global campus does not achieve high quality in online higher education the university of illinois reputation will be damaged we cannot and will not allow this to happen the tenure system facultys central role in gc is our best means of ensuring quality some students have expressed a concern that an increase in the number of u of i degrees as a result of gc will reduce the value of their degrees i have served at two universities illinois and michigan both of which have three campuses the marketboth applicants and employershas a full understanding of these institutions and their various campuses there is no evidence that multiple campuses serving various student constituencies have a negative effect on the value of degrees offered by these institutions indeed the reputation of the university of illinois and the value of all u of i degrees can be enhanced by the university demonstrating that it is the innovation leader in delivering high quality affordable and accessible higher education there is significant operational and financial risk in launching global campus we will need to invest approximately million an amount we can finance and partially recoup through foundation and donor contributions before we begin to generate surpluses operational risks take the form of competition enrollment and revenue shortfalls cost overruns and other potential problems identified in a risk management analysis prepared by the gc team however there is no riskfree path available to the university of illinois not launching gc means that we will to some degree fail in our mission in mastering online education and in securing the money we need to achieve our strategic priorities we are as i said in my inaugural address at a tipping point in one direction is a slow slide to mediocrity which is unacceptable for the u of i in the other is the opportunity though not a guarantee to create a brilliant future i thank all of you for your hard work on behalf of the university of illinois thank you also for your serious engagement in the global campus matter i am confident that working together we will make the wisest possible decisions

20061108115931-020833,date november to faculty staff and students from chancellor richard herman subject reducing energy costs on the urbana campus i am writing to ask for your help in addressing an important issue our campus community faces over the last five years the urbanachampaign campus has realized an unprecedented increase in utility costs this adverse financial impact in utilities was accompanied by new or deepening cost pressures in nearly every area of campus operations today utility costs are now one of the largest components of the nondiscretionary annual costs that negatively impact salary programs tuition rates and program expansion plans president white recently appointed an energy task force of faculty and administrators from uic uiuc uis and university administration to examine the factors impacting energy costs on all university of illinois campuses and make recommendations to minimize energy costs in the future the task force is cochaired by uiuc provost linda katehi and uic provost michael tanner and is expected to submit a preliminary report in march and a final report in may while the task force findings and recommendations are critical to our longerterm energy picture we need not wait for their final report to begin moving toward greater energy responsibility regardless of our eventual energy procurement or management strategies the campus will always benefit from reducing consumption responsible conservation pays benefits both immediately and for the long term it is a universally prudent approach to diminish the spiraling costs of energy consumption that reduce funds available for our primary missions in light of these energy issues i am forming a campus energy conservation committee to develop a clear campus policy for energy use and conservation and help identify areas of energy cost avoidance on the urbana campus i have asked terry ruprecht to serve in a new role of director of energy conservation for the urbana campus he will work with colleges departments and facilities and services to structure conservation efforts and ensure that we begin to reduce campus energy use in addition to the above actions i request that all faculty students and staff take personal responsibility in reducing energy use wherever possible individual efforts may seem small at first glance but they add up significantly across a campus the size of ours all members of our campus community can assist by turning out lights in unoccupied spaces and during unoccupied periods lowering thermostat settings a few degrees in the winter raising thermostat settings a few degrees during the summer air conditioning season assuring that all lights computers monitors copiers and other equipment are shut off for weekends unless specifically needed helping achieve reduced operating hours of heating ventilation and air conditioning systems wherever practical reporting wasteful practices or unnecessary use of energy to facilities and services these kinds of voluntary efforts at other large universities have resulted in a measurable decrease in energy consumption michigan state has seen initial drops in consumption of to percent on a similar request of their campus community thank you for your cooperation in this important effort not only will our entire campus community benefit from this increased attentiveness but will help preserve the environment and precious natural resources,reducing energy costs on the urbana campus,09,2006,Nov,Thursday

20061031153909-014260,date october to faculty staff and students from chancellor richard herman re respect and responsibility i was saddened and disappointed when i learned about the recent zbt and tri delta party that ended up portraying latinoas in stereotypical and denigrating ways students who took part in such behavior were being insensitive thoughtless and quite frankly juvenile although im not in the business of telling students how to think i expect more of our illinois students they are the best and the brightest of the next generation and such callous behavior is beneath them the challenges of our multicultural society demand that each of us constantly examine our biases and work hard to put ourselves in the shoes of people who come from widely varying backgrounds cultures and experiences we can have strong and differing opinions about culture politics and policy but we must never lose touch with granting everyone the kind of respect and dignity we would like others to grant to us everyone of every background is welcome at illinois and i want them to feel welcome as is so often the case with these kinds of incidents the ensuing debate is an education in itself the controversy has spurred a great deal of conversation about treating one another with common decency and that is good the process of reviewing the incident is now underway and i believe a deeper appreciation of our cultural diversity and individual responsibility will be the result vice chancellor renee romano has been working with the various groups involved to turn what i believe to have been poor judgment on the part of students into a learning experience already the controversy has added impetus to our plans to heighten diversity education on campus yet for the insensitivity that was shown i apologize young people are always works in progress and i believe this event will help remind us all to be better and more thoughtful people,respect and responsibility,31,2006,Oct,Tuesday

20060516152026-025294,dear colleagues this is a busy and exciting period for the university as the academic year winds down commencements are held and we prepare for a productive summer i write at this time to provide a brief update on the resource outlook for the university and more important what it means for academic quality and responsible stewardship of the university of illinois i am pleased to report that in a nutshell the resource picture has brightened the state legislature just provided the university its first appropriation increase in five years the board of trustees last month increased tuition and established a funding source to eliminate the academic facilities deferred maintenance backlog over the next decade and private giving is up this year i believe these are leading indicators of a trend toward a better future they mean that we can maintain and strengthen academic quality thus ensuring attraction retention and development of an exceptional faculty and providing the courses sections and classes our students need to receive a highquality education and graduate on time they also mean that we can make progress on fixing our physical infrastructure repairing leaky roofs crumbling concrete and the like i have spoken many times about the need to forge a new compact for financial support of the university of illinois the compact simply means that five parties must do their parts to ensure the university has the resources that are a necessary but not sufficient condition to create the brilliant future we all want for the university of illinois as we put together the universitys budget for fiscal year fy which begins on july the compact is taking shape very effectively here is a summary the first party in the compact is the state of illinois the university of illinois is the states most valuable asset in creating a prosperous future for the people of illinois we have asked the state to do what it can when it can to support the university after four years of cuts and no increases in operating support i am pleased that the legislature has approved a appropriation increase for fiscal which means an incremental million in base operating funds for the university of illinois unfortunately a capital budget did not pass tuition payers and their families are the second party in the compact university trustees last month adopted the administrations recommendation for new tuition levels to support its core teaching mission and a new academic facilities maintenance fund assessment designed to help bring down our million deferred maintenance problem to a proper level within a decade these actions will provide million in fy financial aid from the university and the state has increased and will continue to help many students and their families pay for their u of i education thanks to strong financial aid only half of all u of i students pay full tuition and fees the third party in the compact is our own faculty through your success in attracting research grants and contracts faculty bring almost million a year into the university to support research and the operation of the university we are counting on continued success the fourth party in the compact is private donors individuals corporations and foundations play an important role in supporting the university of illinois through annual and special gifts both expendable and endowment this year total giving is running considerably ahead of last year we believe that another increase in expendable gifts and endowment income from gifts is a reasonable assumption for fy the fifth party in the compact is university leadership at every level reallocation of current spending from lower to higher priorities has become and must remain a way of life at the university of illinois this will come as no surprise to every budget manager we are counting on a reallocation to free up resources across the university to strengthen academic quality and address other priority needs reallocation is hard but necessary to ensure that university leadership is doing its part to support the university of illinois as we ask the state our students and their families the faculty and private donors to do their share as the compact comes together i believe that we can accomplish the following keep a highquality u of i education accessible and affordable turn the corner in strengthening academic quality after four extremely tough budget years serve as good stewards of state assets and fix a large deferred maintenance problem within a decade i said in my inaugural address that we must strive to create a brilliant future for the university of illinois our strategic plans are intended to set that high aspiration level we must also have the resources required for excellence i am pleased that we are making significant progress in this regard i thank all of you for striving for excellence in your own work and for your efforts on behalf of the university of illinois i look forward to working together in the months and years ahead sincerely b joseph white president,a message from president joe white,16,2006,May,Tuesday

20030605155956-004010,dear colleagues with the recent conclusion of this years spring session of the illinois general assembly we now have a much clearer picture of the challenges we face as we prepare the budget for fiscal year the new executive and legislative leadership teams in the state capital were confronted with the most severe financial problems this state has experienced in several decades accordingly the university of illinois pledged to do all we could to shoulder responsibility for our share of this problem it is therefore not surprising that the budget outcomes for the u of i included significant reductions in general fund appropriations in both fy and fy shortly after assuming office and with revenues declining and expenditures growing governor rod blagojevich asked public universities to return as much of their fy appropriations as possible without disrupting academic programs the university of illinois responded by returning million in state appropriations in the fourth quarter of this year this rescission followed a general fund reduction in fy of million from fy the actual loss of state appropriations going from fy to final fy appropriations totaled million or a reduction of nearly percent in addition the university was required to absorb another million payment in fy for health insurance costs as it did in fy the stage thus was set for the justconcluded legislative session in which the governor and lawmakers set out to erase a projected billion state budget deficit the operating budget appropriations for the states public universities for fy which begins july are largely those included in the governors recommended budget for the university of illinois the governor recommended and the general assembly passed a general fund appropriation of milliona million reduction from the fy original appropriation and million less than the fy appropriation the general assembly passed capital appropriations at the governors recommended levels for repair renovation providing a total of million for the three university of illinois campuses notably the general assembly added million that was not included in the governors recommended budget for planning for the lincoln hall remodeling project at uiuc other good news includes the fact that reappropriations for continuing projects such as the college of medicine research building at uic the siebel engineering facility the national center for supercomputing applications the post genomic institute the incubator building chemical sciences at uiuc the uis classroomoffice building and the state survey projects were also included in the capital budget allowing work already under way to continue to move to completion in summary the extraordinarily severe financial problems facing the state resulted in operating and capital appropriations for the university of illinois that were substantially lower than what we had hoped for as we prepared our budget request last summer nevertheless the governor and legislatures taxdollar support will enable the university of illinois to continue to pursue our missions of education research service and economic development further we will strive to maintain the quality that has been the hallmark of the university of illinois despite the diminution of state support high quality distinguishes our three campuses and makes the u of i one of the best universities in the nation the challenge always is to keep our edge in the face of diminished resources and we accomplish this through a dedicated faculty and staff and efficient management i am confident our university has the leadership and spirit to persevere in these difficult times james j stukel president uipresuillinoisedu,presmail,06,2003,Jun,Friday

20030307170856-025392,dear colleagues as you know there are many discussions going on in the state about budget cuts to higher education we must squarely confront the challenge of how to absorb any cuts in a way that respects the principles the provost and i stressed in taking last years cuts and recently outlined in our message to you of february the people of illinois have built urbana champaign over many generations to be an institution of the first class and we will keep it so in letters to the deans and vice chancellors last fall the provost and i asked that planning begin for how to absorb reductions in ways that continue our core missions our strategy is being formed out of those discussions every economy we can create in the performance of administrative functions means fewer cuts will have to be made to the core activities that define what we are a place where superb education prepares students for success in the workplace as citizens and as members of a diverse society with increasingly global dimensions where students learn from exceptionally talented faculty who are creating the knowledge they teach in their classrooms laboratories and independent studies a place where the matchless expertise of our faculty staff and students is applied to critical societal issues and an institution that continually refashions itself to meet new needs embrace new opportunities and provide leadership our approach to reducing administrative expenses will consist of creating clusters of units to share resources within across and between colleges departments centers and campuslevel administrative offices and units we will want to explore opportunities to share where overlapping and similar missions histories of close interaction and geographical proximity will permit the consolidation of business and support functions the scale of these shared business and service centers will be small enough to permit functions to be carried out by people who are knowledgeable about unit practices and close enough to faculty staff and students to be responsive to their needs and deliver effective service just such an approach has been implemented with units in several colleges and administrative units leading to maintenance of effective and responsive services with substantial cost savings we must now examine the possibilities of using this approach more widely to achieve efficiencies and resultant cost savings i am asking unit heads to begin immediately the task of identifying potential clusters of units where shared business and support services can reduce administrative costs while maintaining responsiveness to local needs in doing so unit heads will discuss possibilities with heads of other units within and across lines of colleges schools and campus administrative units i will appoint a coordinating advisory committee to facilitate discussions across the boundaries of our colleges and administrative portfolios i am asking provost richard herman to chair this committee steven miller an illinois alumnus prominent business leader and member of the board of the university of illinois foundation will serve as external advisor with knowledge of organizational models in business and the academy members of the committee will include leaders of administrative and service units executive officers of colleges and departments professionals who work in business and support services at all levels supervisors students and faculty members the composition of this committee will be announced as soon as it is formed i am requesting that the coordinating advisory committee provide its advice to me by april so that the committees contribution can be fully integrated into our plans for the fy budget a major task of this committee will be to assure that shared business and support service centers are implemented in ways that are equitable to all units and serve the overriding interests of the campus as a whole creation of shared business and service centers will not by itself achieve sufficient savings to absorb the full reductions we will take in fy but this step will help to absorb much of those reductions by streamlining administrative services which must be a cornerstone of any strategy to preserve the excellence of our university with diminished resources cordially nancy cantor chancellor,creating shared business and support centers,07,2003,Mar,Friday

20020702120256-015473,dear colleagues with the board of trustees approval of the tuition increase last week the long process of determining our budget for next year is coming to a close as you probably read in the newspapers the million budget cut for our campus forecast in our january letter to you has turned out to be million out of a cut to the ui system of million as a result we must make reductions that are large will affect most every unit on campus and will have real consequences we want to share with you the strategy we are following in making these cuts how the strategy was developed and what it will mean for all of us we began planning for these cuts last fall we consulted with students in town meetings about tuition policy and in discussions with the student tuition policy advisory committee we sought the advice of the faculty campus budget oversight committee and the deans budget committee and we consulted with the deans throughout the planning process there emerged from these discussions a set of priorities that would guide our planning high priority was given to protecting the institutions excellence and stature by preserving its ability to attract and retain superb faculty members its capacity for renewal and innovation by supporting new initiatives that can make signal contributions and maintaining a research environment that nurtures scholarly achievement at the highest levels high priority also was given to coping with budget cuts in ways that would maintain the quality of our educational programs and preserve students timely access to courses needed to meet degree requirements and to graduate on time the campus engagement with the states citizens communities public agencies and businesses was given priority as well along with the need to maintain essential services for students public safety and equal opportunity programs we have also given priority to financial aid for students for whom the higher tuition would be a hardship as we pledged to the students in our discussions with them about a possible tuition increase to protect these priorities as much as possible we devised a budgetary strategy the first element of the strategy was the decision to make differential budget cuts allocating lower cuts to units whose work most directly affects these campus priorities as such academic units received lower cuts average of than administrative and service units average of among academic units lower cuts were made to budgets of units where priorities of research excellence and major instructional responsibilities intersect where engagement with pressing societal needs is fostered and where the institution is investing in initiatives and opportunities the university librarys centrality to the campus missions and standing and its value as a public resource were recognized with a cut of only and no cuts were made to essential programs including graduate fellowships the division of rehabilitation education services and the council on teacher education similarly within the administrative and service units cuts were made differentially based on the units centrality to these campus priorities no cuts were made to the mckinley health center the principals scholars program university high school the campus honors program the office of equal opportunity and access or the division of public safety because of the importance of their special roles the essential contribution of student affairs units to serving students needs and interests was recognized with a cut of only the second element of the budgetary strategy was a decision to use all available resources to mitigate the immediate damaging effects of the budget cuts and provide a soft landing that would allow the cuts to be absorbed over a period of time this approach mirrored the campus use of more than m in reserves to help cover the fy rescission and it became the institutionwide financial strategy at all levels of the institution the campus the colleges individual departments and unitsevery effort would be made to ameliorate the most harmful immediate effects of the cuts on the campus core missions by reallocating all available resources to cover a portion of the necessary reductions where possible in the short term the third element of the budgetary strategy was a decision to use new resources strategically to support our highest priorities the new funds provided by the additional tuition increase approved last week were allocated in a way that allowed the budget cuts to units to be made differentially directing support to campus priorities additionally most of the funds generated by the fy tuition surcharge million have been allocated to provide educational enhancements recommended by the student tuition policy advisory committee and identified as targets for investment in our covenant with the students concerning how surcharge funds would be used access to general education courses access to high demand majors and essential courses library operations and services vital student services graduate fellowships critical campus network maintenance and essential classroom upgrades using new funds in these ways will allow us to continue to move ahead despite the budget cut in areas that are most critical to our educational and research missions we believe that this strategy for absorbing our budget cut will protect our core missions and activities to the extent possible difficult decisions had to be made at all levels of the institution decisions that no one wanted to make but could not be avoided they were made in a principled way based on our priorities for the present and future of this campus above all we have sought to protect this institutions exceptional quality and make sure that it continues to be the kind of university that drew us all here but there is no denying that however much we wish otherwise the budget cut will have costs to our people and our programs our students will pay higher tuition next year they will have fewer courses to choose from and seats may be harder to find in their desired courses at their desired times in many areas class sizes will be larger and fewer elective courses will be taught our resources to support research will be constrained and our public engagement will be reduced the salary freeze will prevent our recognizing in a tangible way the exceptional accomplishments of our faculty and staff during the past year the most bitter consequence of all will be the loss of valued employees the size of our faculty will be reduced by approximately colleagues through normal attrition over the next couple of years most reductions to other employee groups also will occur through attrition but a number of terminations and layoffs will be necessary indeed this process has already begun the next several years will be challenging ones for all of us for our part we will work energetically to bring new resources to the campus and manage our way through this financial crisis so that we emerge on the other side positioned to move ahead rapidly as new funds become available the excellence and dedication of all who work here are precious assets that have made this institution what it is this is perhaps our most valuable resource for coping with the stresses that this period brings the campus has for a long time been a wonderful place to make a career this downturn will not change that the coming period will be a time of tight fiscal constraint and retrenchment in many areas but it also must be a time of progress on some key fronts the ability to launch bold new ideas with early investments has led to some of our universitys most important achievements and we will continue to find ways to take advantage of exceptional opportunities and leverage quality across the campus we will find ways to fund strategic faculty recruitment and the retention of essential colleagues and we will continue to encourage faculty members to come together to create new opportunities for achievement our commitment to excellence through support of diversity and opportunities to make signal contributions will continue to move the institution ahead along the paths we have laid out together our university has long conducted its affairs by relying on the thoughtful judgments of decisionmakers within the units the heads of departments schools colleges and administrative and service units their tireless efforts in working with us over the last six months to craft our budgetary strategy have once again earned the trust we place in them and the confidence we place in our outstanding faculty and staff has been earned many times over by your accomplishments and devotion we know that the last few months have been a time of uncertainty and anxiety and we thank you for your continued dedication to one of americas great public universities cordially nancy cantor richard h herman,budget message to the campus

important in their own right these projects have a strong symbolic value they say that the university of illinois will continue to grow deeper in the areas in which we already have the advantage of great strength stukel said the campus chancellors provosts deans directors and department heads have spent the last six months on fy and fy budget issues and that their continued leadership is essential to keeping the u of i moving ahead even in difficult times he estimates some positions will be lost across the whole university most positions will be through attrition but there have been and will be layoffs of staff state general tax support is the backbone of the universitys day today operating budget stukel said it is the essential third however in that it pays most salaries and wages for faculty and staff puts books in the libraries and equipment in the labs and powers our buildings at the chicago springfield and urbanachampaign campuses and at our offcampus sites such as our extension offices all across illinois he said the university of illinois which enrolls more than students on campus is labor intensive some percent of the state funded portion of the universitys operating budget is committed to salaries and wages and in some academic departments as much as percent of the budget is tied up in personnel earlier this year stukel announced a general hiring and salary freeze with exceptions needing high level approval the magnitude of the cuts requires that we reach into our most valuable assetour peopleto help cover the loss stukel said all of us who care about this university are deeply concerned about longrange effects and jeopardizing our competitive edge the universitys board of trustees is scheduled to discuss a tuition increase soon that adds up to percent to increases the board already endorsed for the coming school year percent at chicago percent at springfield and percent at urbanachampaign the total percent increase over the academic year just ending will generate about million in net revenue cents of each new tuition dollar raised will be turned immediately into student financial aid so u of i students who are least able to pay the increase are essentially held harmless if the additional tuition is not approved the university will have to cut personnel more deeply stukel said the university cannot escape negative impacts on its essential educational mission it is a clearcut causeandeffect he said fewer faculty in the classrooms means fewer sections and fewer options for our students and other troublesome results at our core we are educators and it is this mission we will work hardest to protect stukel thanked gov george ryan who is an ex officio member of the universitys board of trustees the house and senate leaders and the other members of the legislature for their support during the budget session and lasthour negotiations he singled out for special thanks reps rick winkel of champaign tom berns of urbana and bill black of danville and retiring sen stan weaver of urbana this session has been quite a challenge and were grateful to have emerged where we have we know the outcome could have been far worse for those who stayed with us we extend our deepest gratitude he said,press release re the new state budget,05,2002,Jun,Wednesday

20020315174725-028587,dear colleagues it has been two months since we wrote to you about the campus budgetary outlook and we want to update you on recent developments many of you probably saw news stories last week concerning what the effects of possible budget cuts might be on our campus and across the ui system our fy budget has not yet been finalized but recent events have given us a better idea of what to expect and our planning for possible cutswhich was just beginning when we last wrote to youis farther along now we want to share these expectations and plans with you so that you will know what the situation looks like as of this moment as you know in december we were asked to take a rescission for the current year that turned out to be million of which the largest portion was health care costs that in the past have been paid by the state at that time we expected that this amount would become a permanent cut to our state budget for next year after our january letter to you the states financial situation continued to deteriorate making additional budget reductions necessary these additional reductions were incorporated in the governors proposed fy budget which was presented in february also during this time both the ui system and the campus worked on identifying unavoidable new costssuch as price increases for utilities liability insurance and higher medicare coststhat we would have to find a way to pay regardless of how the state appropriation turned out the result became in effect a base budget cut to uiuc for next year of million which is the amount that we are now planning to absorb we have been working with the deans and the heads of our administrative units and consulting with student and faculty groups to plan how to protect our highest priorities while absorbing the expected budget cut in doing so we have been guided by the principles outlined in our january letter to you finding ways to cope with our shortterm financial circumstance that continue our forward movement build on our recent accomplishments if at a slower pace than had been hoped and protect our missions of teaching research and public engagement one of the conclusions that emerged from this planning process has been that we should absorb as much of the expected budget cut as possible by using campuslevel funds in order to reduce the cuts to campus units as much as we can in addition we expect to provide a limited amount of nonrecurring funds for the first year or two so that units do not have to absorb the full cut in only one year the cost of using campuslevel funds is that we will have much less capacity to support special needs and requests than we have been accustomed to in recent years for example we are committing the preponderance of the remaining faculty excellence funds to absorbing part of the budget cut we cannot begin to absorb the entire reduction from campus resources however and substantial cuts will have to be made to the budgets of all units the cuts we face are serious and much as we would wish otherwise they will have human consequences most of our budget is in human resourcesthe talented and dedicated faculty and staff members on whom our enterprise most depends across all of our academic departments an average of more than of departmental budgets is committed to salaries thus it is unavoidable that there will be some reductions in the numbers of faculty and staff naturally we will try to absorb these reductions through the normal process of attrition as much as possible faculty reductions will be accomplished through attrition but there may have to be some staff layoffs budget cuts of the size we expect will have impact across the campus as the budget picture continues to clarify we will consult with the deans the heads of our administrative units with the faculty campus budget oversight committee and others about how the cuts should be made based on this broad consultation we will decide how to proceed our decisions will be principled ones as we promised in our earlier letter to you and as a result cuts will be made differentially to protect our highest priorities and most important values we will try to protect our core missions by cutting budgets of administrative units more than the budgets of the academic units we have asked administrative units to plan for cuts of to and academic units have been asked to plan for cuts averaging to for planning purposes we have used much of the yield of the proposed tuition increase to address the budget shortfall off the top distribution of the remainder of the tuition increase to the academic units will ameliorate the effect of the budget cuts there though the necessary cuts remain very significant cuts to academic and administrative units will not be made across the board but rather will reflect careful appraisal of priorities and opportunities to move ahead in some key areas the plan we have described assumes approval of the additional tuition increase that has been proposed added to the increase previously approved for next year the total tuition proposal is for a increase the increase will allow us to protect the full yield of the tuition surcharge for allocation to the educational enhancements for which it was intended surcharge funds will enable us to provide a number of new faculty positions and other programmatic improvements even as units are cutting their budgets by such means we hope to be able to continue to make progress in a number of critical areas as noted in our last letter to you while at the same time preserving some capacity to act on new ideas and make critical crosscampus investments of the kind that have been so important to our success as an institution we know that the shortterm outlook we have described raises concerns for the whole campus community concerns that we fully share our recent successincluding this year an upturn in the number of faculty members for the first time in more than twenty yearshas given us a solid foundation for withstanding the cuts that will have to be made the principles that are guiding our planning will as we have described allow us to continue to make progress on a number of fronts during this period as well as positioning the institution to move ahead dramatically when the states finances begin to improve in the interim we will continue to aggressively pursue opportunities for increased private foundation support research funding and other sources of revenue it is likely that we will not be making final decisions until late may or early june by that time the general assembly will have enacted a budget and we will know final tuition policy as well we will keep you apprised of any significant developments as we monitor the situation and continue to develop campus strategy for dealing with the reductions very truly yours nancy cantor chancellor richard h herman provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs,budget

of student financial aid student trustee eamon kelly will moderate the meeting the meeting will offer detailed information about the tuition proposal and provide a chance for you to raise questions and share your opinions before getting into specifics we want to emphasize that we will deal with our financial situation in ways that protect our missions of teaching research and public engagement we will continue to support the highest quality of education for our students we intend to make sure that the funds generated by the tuition surcharge are used for the educational enhancements that were promised when the surcharge was approved and we will keep this institution moving forward as one of the nations premier public research universities the budget problem we face is this like other states across the country state revenues in illinois are falling significantly short of what had been expected as a result the state will not be able to provide the full amounts that were appropriated this year for its agencies and operation including higher education in our case the campus will have to cut spending in the current year by million depending on how long the economy takes to recover this situation is likely to continue into next year and beyond although the outlook remains uncertain for planning purposes we are assuming that next years appropriation of state funds to our campus will be smaller than this years allocation here is what we propose to do first we will try to minimize the effect of this years budget cut on our academic units and their teaching and research in order to do this the campus administration will provide as much of the needed funds as possible by contributing campus reserves and other flexible funds we will be able to furnish onehalf of the total amount the other half will be provided by campus units reducing their expenditures we will protect the priority of our teaching research and public engagement missions by asking administrative and service units to reduce their expenditures for the year by while academic units reduce their expenditures by because the university library is central to the quality of the whole campus and there is a clear need for additional investment the library will not be required to cut its spending second we are trying to plan how to absorb a permanent budget cut next year in ways that protect our core missions especially our ability to deliver the quality of education that brought you to this campus we have asked the deans and vice chancellors to consider how they can minimize any effects of permanent budget cuts on our programs of teaching and research we will work vigorously to increase fundraising and finally a proposal is being considered for increasing tuition next year by an additional or about per year for undergraduates enrolled for a full program at the base tuition rate this increase would provide about onefourth of the funds that we expect to lose to budget cuts next year the rationale for onefourth is that tuition provides roughly one quarter of the universitys funds that can be brought to bear on the budget problem the idea of increasing tuition arose when it became clear that fundraising the campus administration the colleges and the administrative units cannot absorb the full budget cuts we are likely to face and at the same time protect our core missions to the extent we believe is essential there seems no alternative but to ask students to participate in a limited way in maintaining the quality of our programs the increase that is proposed includes a plan to set aside almost of the new tuition dollars for the purpose of providing increased financial aid to those who would see additional need as a result of the proposed raise in tuition such a set aside reflects our past policy and has proven very effective as you may know many of our peer institutions face cuts deeper than ours the momentum that we have built up over the past several years may be slowed by these cuts in the short term but we are determined that it will not stop to this end we have just allocated funds from this years tuition surcharge to the colleges with the advice of faculty and student advisory committees we have provided support for new faculty positions graduate fellowships and advising between now and march when the board of trustees will vote on a tuition proposal there will be a series of meetings with many student groups organized by student trustee kelly and including other members of the student tuition policy advisory committee who provided advice about allocating funds from the tuition surcharge and who have considered the universitys financial situation in detail we also invite you to take part in these meetings and to offer your opinions and raise questions about matters of concern by email to us at provostuiucedu we face serious challenges working together we believe these challenges can be met in a way that preserves the quality of your education and the special strengths of our university we look forward to discussing these matters in the coming dialogue about our financial situation and how best to deal with it

20020123060443-011069,january dear colleague as you learn more about the financial difficulties we face as a nation as a state and as a university i hope you will keep in mind that we are rich in the most important resource needed to help us weather this tough time our superb faculty and staff and so it is to you that i turn today our resilience is great we have managed our way through cuts recessions and rescissions before this is not to understate the seriousness of a midyear cut of some million about percent into the existing statesupported part of our budget it is our deepest cut in more than years nor should we understate the negative impact of that cut carrying into the fy fiscal year plus having to pay for unavoidablessuch as medicare hikes in property and liability insurance operations and maintenance for new space and utilityprice increases our calculation of the fy problem todayassuming our cuts are permanenttops million or about percent of our state appropriation and the illinois economy has not yet turned around we discussed these issues at length with our board of trustees last week and talked with them about how we will manage we said then that we believe that our students who gain so much in earning power and other benefits from a university of illinois education should pay onefourth of the loss and that painful internal reallocation will cover the remaining threefourths i am sharing with you today a statement of principles that will guide the chancellors provosts and other leaders as they approach the wise management of spending reductions for both this year and next two concepts quality and local control are central to how we will accomplish what we must you have my assurance that as with all important matters collegiality and consensus will prevail but all will be held accountable here is how we will approach difficult choices that must and will be made we will reexamine what is most central to the mission of this university what must be protected and where investments should be made the decisions will be made carefully in consultation with campus leaders and faculty they will be based on our shared values and collective vision we cannot afford to cut spending across the board or declare a moratorium on newprogram development and initiatives we must continue to move forward by capitalizing on new opportunities and ideas in ways that have played such an important role in making our university the great institution it is today and we will but we also must be realistic to address these serious budget cuts we will have to reduce faculty and staff numbers through attrition reduce some services curtail some remodeling reduce facility maintenance and scale back or delay important academic program expansions inevitably this will lead to increased class sizes and may result in loss of momentum in significant new initiatives such as those in economic development genomics nanotechnology and information technology but that is the reality of the environment we face the following guiding principles will help the chancellors and other university of illinois leaders manage the spending reductions for both this year and next the university will maintain its fiduciary responsibilities where laws rules or regulations require examples auxiliary operations where bond covenants exist the hospital and clinics where medicaremedicaid and thirdparty payor requirements apply research funded by federal state or industry contracts and gifts restricted by donors quality will drive all decisions we will insulate services to our primary clients namely our students and patients our highest priority is to protect the quality of our undergraduate education programs in particular we will ensure that undergraduates can schedule classes so they can graduate on time the university will plan for fy by anticipating a second difficult budget year i want to be certain that we have sufficient resources to meet unavoidable spending increases for insurance utilities price increases and key academic programs such as the uis capital scholars program we will protect the universitys highest priorities over time although some key projects may be delayed in the short term and once the board of trustees has approved the general boundaries for addressing these serious budget challenges we will support decentralized decisionmaking that permits the chancellors provosts deans and department heads to make the appropriate local judgments to best meet our education research and outreach objectives these principles are important guideposts but the hard work of restructuring both this years and next years budgets requires good will and forbearance among the university of illinois family we are important citizens in a strong state and so have to work through our share of illinoiss difficulty this is not an easy task but we surely are up to it thank you for your help james j stukel president uipresuillinoisedu,presmail,24,2002,Jan,Thursday

20020104191048-014976,dear colleagues it was less than two months ago that we wrote to you inviting you to join in a campuswide dialogue to shape the future of our campus to ensure academic excellence to continue and expand our national leadership role when we issued our invitation the states financial outlook was deteriorating and we did not know how the campus resources might be affected the nearterm prospects for state revenues have clarified over the last few weeks we want to share with you what we now know about our financial circumstance and describe how we propose to deal with the situation we face before turning to specifics however we want to reiterate the conviction expressed in our earlier letter it is imperative now more than ever that we think as creatively as we can about scholarly and educational opportunities that will define our institution for the years to come as an institution facing some tight fiscal constraints we like many of our peers do not have the luxury of feeding all of our aspirations as a great institution we also do not have the luxury of standing still for we will slide back quickly if we pass up opportunities for investment in areas ripe for discovery we will need to be exceedingly clever and opportunistic in finding sources of support nevertheless we must redouble our commitment to moving forward with these thoughts in mind we turn now to the details of our current budgetary outlook like other states across the country state revenues in illinois are falling significantly short of what had been expected as a result the state will not be able to provide the full amounts that were budgeted for its agencies and operation including higher education in the current fiscal year in our case the campus will have to spend million less than we previously had budgeted for this year this reflects a universitywide number of million the largest portion million of the million of this shortfall results from the requirement that the campus pay a larger share of employee health care costs which in the past have been paid by the state all of this is likely to continue into fiscal year although the outlook remains uncertain we do not know what if any new funds will be available to us from the state for next year we thus face two different financial questions how shall we reduce expenditures in the current year by million how shall we plan for a fy state budget that may well be somewhat smaller than this years budget these questions arise at a time when our campus has gained considerable momentum across a broad front with important new programs and initiatives while the questions we face are financial our answers to them must be grounded in institutional values and aspirations we must find ways to cope with our shortterm financial circumstance that continue our forward movement that build on our accomplishments of recent years if at a slower pace than had been hoped and that protect our missions of teaching research and public engagement in order to accomplish these goals we will have to make harder choices than in recent years our campus has had to make such choices before and in doing so we have become a stronger institution we must examine anew what is most important to our missions and our aspirations what must be protected and where investments must be made our decisions must be principled choices based on our shared vision for this institution among other things this vision requires us to protect and enhance our library as a priceless asset to realize the postgenomic initiative to show leadership in general education and in the humanistic disciplines that support it to create a truly diverse campus to build our graduate fellowship support and to preserve our capacity to act on new ideas and to make critical crosscampus programmatic investments the alternativesto make no choices and instead reduce expenditures across the board to declare a moratorium on programmatic development and initiativesare not options for us they would mean separating our actions from our values ignoring our own institutional history turning our back on our aspirations at least until times get better these are not the practices that brought us all to illinois these are not the practices that will take charge of our institutional future here is what we propose to do in order to minimize the effect of the current years million shortfall on our units we will provide as much of the needed funds as possible by contributing campus reserves and other flexible funds we will furnish onehalf of the total amount the other half will be provided by campus units reducing their expenditures they will not be asked to do so on an acrosstheboard basis however rather we will protect the priority of our teaching research and public engagement missions by asking administrative and service units to reduce their expenditures for the year by while academic units reduce their expenditures by the university library will not be required to participate in this rescission as we have said we do not know what the fy budget will look like the governor will first put his budget before the legislature in february by that time we hope to have a much better understanding of the states fiscal picture for now we are working with a range of scenarios including one based on the assumption that the fy campus budget will be smaller than the fy budget in that scenario this years midyear reduction of expenditures would become a permanent cut in next years base budget for fy we have asked the deans and vice chancellors to consider how to deal with base budget rescissions in ways that protect the core missions of the campus including our ability to invest in areas of great opportunity insofar as possible we plan to continue to provide some cash relief to the units during at least fy in order to ease the effect of a base budget rescission in this way our planning for next year will seek to allow us to continue to realize some of key initiatives already underway as well as some of those yet to be dreamt as you may know a number of public universities began suffering cuts last year many of our peer institutions face rescissions deeper than ours clearly higher education nationally is in for a bit of a rough ride however it has been clear for many years that all universities especially publics need to diversify their approach to funding we took a step in this direction last year with a tuition rise and we expect private fund raising efforts to increase we are faced with a harder set of choices than we expected and while the momentum that we have built up over the past several years will be slowed we are determined that it will not stop to this end we have just responded to unit requests for monies from this years tuition surcharge with the advice of various faculty and student advisory committees we have provided support for new faculty positions graduate fellowships and advising our goals will include protecting those surcharge dollars especially as they reflect a compact with our students and the faculty excellence funds which have served us so well this past year we hired faculty and for the first time in twenty years our faculty numbers have increased by behind these numbers are wonderful individuals and significant programmatic expansion these are hard fought gains which must be retained we face serious challenges working together we believe these challenges can be met in a way that preserves the special strengths of our university and allows us to continue to make significant progress in areas that are most critical and rich in opportunity very truly yours nancy cantor richard h herman chancellor provost and vice chancellor for academic

aftermath of september a safety and security update the university of illinois at urbanachampaign is committed to maintaining a welcoming environment that enables all members of the campus community to live and work in safety in the aftermath of the september terrorist attacks a large number of campus personnel have been actively reviewing our programs and operations to identify possible changes that will enhance our safety and security some of the steps taken will be obvious such as the new security protocols at willard airport and at memorial stadium while other steps will be done out of the public view for security reasons we are fortunate to be able to draw on faculty and staff who are experts in the areas of terrorism emergency response safety and security for these reviews we are also fortunate to have strong ties to the local state and federal authorities agencies and professional associations that provide expert support and advice i am providing a summary of some of our ongoing activities to give you an idea of the breadth of activities that are occurring notification of potential threats the university of illinois police department uipd maintains close contact with the federal bureau of investigation fbi the fbi keeps all law enforcement agencies informed of potential threats across the united states and around the world it is important to note that there are no known threats directed toward universities in the united states at this time however we must be vigilant it is important to report to uipd any unusual or suspicious activities so they can be properly
