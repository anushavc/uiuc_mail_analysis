 Subject: MASSMAIL - Message to members of the Illinois family","Members of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign family:

Early this morning three people were shot at a private house party near 
campus. We write now to share with you what we know of this incident and 
to assure you that counselors are available to help you cope with any 
anxiety it has created.

The details of the incident are still unfolding and a rigorous 
investigation is under way, but we do know that police quickly determined 
the shooting stemmed from a conflict at the party. 

The extent of the three victims' injuries has not been released. We do 
know that one of the victims is a student at the University of Illinois 
at Urbana-Champaign -- senior football student-athlete Trulon Henry, a 
two-year starter for the Fighting Illini. He was shot in the hand and 
underwent surgery. He will miss the remainder of the regular season, and 
his status for a possible bowl appearance is unknown.
 
Henry, who was not originally at the party, was called by a teammate to 
go to the location to help encourage the players at the party to leave. 
Henry was one of three people shot. 

Officers from Urbana, the University of Illinois, Champaign and Champaign 
County responded to the scene. Because the incident happened within the 
jurisdiction of the Urbana police, that agency is leading the response 
and investigation. U. of I. police are assisting. The investigation 
includes interviewing witnesses, gathering evidence at the scene and 
continuing to search for the suspect, who is described as a black man, 
younger than 30 years old, with dreadlocks and wearing a dark coat. He 
was last seen leaving the scene in a silver Dodge Charger with black 
racing stripes.

We urge any witnesses to come forward and cooperation with authorities. 

U. of I. police said there was never any threat to students elsewhere on 
campus, but as soon as the police were able to confer with Urbana 
officers and confirm the appropriate information to be released, they 
sent an Illini-Alert to the campus. Additionally, Student Affairs staff 
members called sorority and fraternity houses in the area to alert them. 
Our own police department is working closely with the Urbana Police 
Department and has stepped up its patrols in the area and on the campus.


We want to emphasize that counselors also are ready to assist students, 
faculty, and staff.  If students or student groups need immediate 
counseling assistance, they should call the Emergency Dean at 217-333-
0050. As always, counseling services are available to students by calling 
217-333-3704, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The number for 
faculty and staff to call for counseling is 217-244-5312.

Incidents like this have a profound effect on all of us.  They can cause 
anxiety and concern.  Some people may feel the stress more deeply than 
others.  Please look out for those around you.  Students, friends, and 
colleagues may be particularly sensitive.  Small acts of kindness can 
help them and can strengthen our community. 
 
We appreciate the concern, empathy, and assistance that all of you in the 
University of Illinois community offer at a time like this. 
 
Sincerely,
 
Mike                       Phyllis

 Subject: CRIME ALERT","INCIDENT:   Shooting Near Campus
 
OCCURRED:   November 13, 2011 at approximately 3:25 AM  

LOCATION:   1004 South Lincoln Avenue, Urbana

BRIEF DETAILS:

The Urbana Police Department is investigating a shooting that occurred 
near campus at 1004 South Lincoln Avenue, Urbana.

On November 13, 2011 at approximately 3:25 AM, a shooting occurred near 
campus during a party at 1004 South Lincoln Avenue in Urbana.  An 
altercation developed between attendees and the offender fired several 
shots into the crowd, which was estimated at more than 100 people. Three 
people were shot and transported to the hospital.  One of the victims is 
a University of Illinois student.  

At this time, the Urbana Police have determined that the shooting was an 
isolated incident that occurred as a result of an argument between 
individuals at the party.

The campus sent an IlliniAlert to the entire campus informing them of the 
incident and alerting them to avoid the area. Additionally, Student 
Affairs staff called every Greek house in the area to alert them. The 
University of Illinois Police Department will provide additional 
information as soon as available. 

OFFENDER DESCRIPTIONS:

The offender is described as a black male, 20s, wearing a dark coat and 
last seen leaving the scene of the shooting in a silver Dodge Charger 
with black racing stripes.

Information about the race or ethnicity of alleged offenders is provided 
only to aid detailed descriptions that include physical stature, clothing 
or unusual characteristics.  Racial descriptions do not by themselves 
offer a meaningful picture of an individual's appearance. 

POLICE RESPONSE:

The Urbana Police Department and University of Illinois Police Department 
continues to actively work to identify and apprehend the offender in this 
incident.  Witnesses to this event or those with information are 
encouraged to contact the Urbana Police Department at 217-384-2320. 
University Police have assigned additional patrols in the area for the 
immediate future.

SAFETY INFORMATION:

Members of the campus community are strongly encouraged to follow these 
safety tips to decrease their potential for becoming a victim:

-Stay alert - call the police immediately to report suspicious activity 
and/or if this subject is observed.

-Trust your instincts - if it does not feel right, call for help.

-Avoid walking alone at night. Travel in groups when possible and always 
walk in well-lit, heavily traveled areas. 

-Turn down your electronic devices. Excessive volume or use of electronic 
devices (iPods, PDAs, cell phones, etc.) can distract you from potential 
safety hazards.

-If you choose to consume alcohol, please drink moderately - remember 
your ability to respond is diminished by over-consumption of alcohol.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Procurement legislation","Dear Faculty and Staff,

I'm pleased to share with you some very good news from Springfield.

During the veto session, the General Assembly passed legislation that 
will address a substantial number of challenges we've been confronting in 
the area of procurement. Library purchases and entertainment (including 
sporting event) contracts will be exempted from the very difficult and 
costly state procurement processes we've been experiencing in the past 
couple of years. In addition, procurement requirements related to our 
research and healthcare enterprises will be afforded improved 
opportunities for waivers under the new legislation.

We're grateful to our legislators for working closely with us to obtain 
these accommodations. In particular, House Speaker Michael Madigan and I 
worked closely with our staffs to develop these important exemptions and 
accommodations. I'm enormously grateful to Speaker Madigan for his 
support of the University of Illinois and recognition of our unique 
situation. I also appreciate the support of House Majority Leader Barbara 
Flynn Currie and Representative Naomi Jakobsson, as well as Senate 
President John Cullerton and Senator Mike Frerichs, who assisted us in 
moving the legislation forward during this brief veto session. Our other 
local legislators have also offered support for our efforts, for which 
we're grateful.

In addition, I want to recognize Kappy Laing and her outstanding 
Governmental Relations staff. They worked closely with me over the last 
several months to make our case to members of the General Assembly on 
this issue and worked especially tirelessly over the last several weeks 
as we worked with our legislators to develop this much-needed legislation.

I know that this has been an issue that has troubled many of us. It has 
cost us time and threatened the effectiveness and success of our 
missions. I'm pleased that we were able to work with our legislators to 
find a fair path ahead that ensured our continued high ethical standards, 
while not impeding the many contributions we make to the State and its 
citizens.

We aren't quite out of the woods yet. Governor Pat Quinn will still need 
to approve the legislation, and I can assure you that we will work with 
the Governor and his staff to convey the value and importance of this 
bill.

Sincerely,
Mike

Michael J. Hogan
President

 Subject: UPDATE ON RECENT CRIME ALERTS","UPDATE ON RECENT CRIME ALERTS

Tuesday, Nov. 08, 2011

Members of the Campus Community,

The University of Illinois Police Department would like to take the 
opportunity to provide some updates regarding recent Crime Alerts sent to 
the campus community. 

HIT & RUN ACCIDENT AT FOURTH AND SPRINGFIELD, CHAMPAIGN 

On Oct. 30, 2011 at 2:17 a.m., Champaign Police responded to the 
intersection of Fourth and Springfield to a hit-and-run accident where 
two University of Illinois students in the crosswalk were struck by a 
white 4-door passenger vehicle.  Neither the hit-and-run driver nor 
vehicle has been located. 
    
The families of the two students are offering a $5000 reward for 
information leading to the conviction of the driver. 

This investigation is continuing, and the Champaign Police Department is 
asking for assistance from the public.  Anyone with information can 
contact the Champaign Police Department at 217-351-4545, the University 
of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216, or anonymously call Crime 
Stoppers at 217-373-TIPS (8477).  An anonymous web tip can be given at 
www.373tips.com or text keyword CCTIP plus the tip information to: 274637 
(CRIMES). Crime Stoppers will pay a reward up to $1,000 for information 
leading to the arrest of the driver of this vehicle. 


MULTIPLE BURGLARIES AT WESTON HALL, 1209 EUCLID STREET, CHAMPAIGN 

The University of Illinois Police Department investigated a series of 
burglaries and attempted burglaries that occurred during the early 
morning hours at Weston Hall on Oct. 23, 2011. 

On Oct. 24, 2011, University of Illinois Police Officers were dispatched 
to investigate an in-progress burglary to a motor vehicle near the area 
of Gregory Avenue and Dorner Drive.  The suspect in the incident 
attempted to flee from University of Illinois Police officers, but was 
apprehended.  Through investigative efforts it was learned that this 
suspect was responsible for the burglaries associated with the Crime 
Alert.  The suspect, later identified as Steven Labana, was a resident at 
Weston Hall.  Labana admitted entering multiple rooms inside Weston Hall 
and taking property that did not belong to him.  Labana was arrested and 
charged with burglary, burglary from a motor vehicle, criminal damage to 
property, resisting a peace officer and possession of drug 
paraphernalia.  

As a reminder, it is very important for faculty, staff and students to 
secure their personal belongings and lock their doors as most burglaries 
that occur on campus are crimes of opportunity and easily preventable.


AGGRAVATED ROBBERY AT 602 EAST DANIEL STREET, CHAMPAIGN 

The Champaign Police and University of Illinois Police Departments 
continue to investigate an aggravated robbery that occurred in front of 
The Espresso Royale located at 602 E. Daniel Street, Champaign. 
Through an ongoing investigation, the Champaign Police Department 
obtained a warrant on Oct. 27 for the arrest of Dennis H. Boston IV, 19, 
who listed an address in the 500 block of East Daniel Street, Champaign.  
Boston was arraigned on Nov. 3 in Champaign County Circuit Court for 
armed robbery and aggravated robbery and is currently being held on 
$125,000 bond.   The second offender, who displayed a handgun, has not 
been apprehended. 

In a continuing effort to apprehend the second offender, we encourage the 
campus community to review the security camera footage that captured the 
incident.  The security camera images may be viewed by visiting 
http://youtu.be/G0-9pIMdP6Q 

This investigation is continuing, and the Champaign Police Department is 
still asking for assistance from the public to identify the second 
offender.  Anyone with information can contact the Champaign Police 
Department at 217-351-4545, the University Of Illinois Police Department 
at 217-333-1216, or anonymously call Crime Stoppers at 217-373-TIPS

keyword CCTIP plus the tip information to: 274637 (CRIMES). Crime 
Stoppers will pay a reward up to $1,000 for information leading to the 
arrest of the second offender. 


ADDITIONAL NEWS AND NOTES

The University of Illinois has been awarded a United States Department of 
Justice 2011 COPS Hiring Program Grant.  The three-year grant, with an 
award of $616,000, will allow the University of Illinois Police 
Department to increase staffing by three officers.  The grant will allow 
the police department to provide the University of Illinois community 
with greater educational and problem solving opportunities by adding 
police officer positions for two full-time crime prevention specialists 
and one full-time crime analyst.  The University of Illinois Police 
Department is one of 238 agencies nationwide to receive an award through 
this competitive grant opportunity.

The goal of the University's grant is to increase the problem solving 
capabilities of the police department and community members.  The police 
department will collaborate with various campus and community partners to 
address issues surrounding sexual assault, alcohol abuse and the 
incidence of crimes such as robbery and aggravated battery.  

As an added safety measure for the winter months, the University of 
Illinois Police Department has extended the hours of its SafeWalks 
program.  SafeWalks is a courtesy service provided to University of 
Illinois students, faculty, or staff so they do not have to walk alone 
within the campus district.  Individuals who are interested in a SafeWalk 
should contact the University of Illinois Police Student Patrol at 217-
333-1216 or press an emergency phone button and wait for a dispatcher 
during their expanded operating hours (7 p.m. to 2 a.m. Sunday through 
Wednesday and 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. Thursday through Saturday).  Please allow 
at least 20 minutes notice for a SafeWalk.

 Subject: ANNUAL TEST OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE/EVACUATION PLANS","Members of the Campus Community,

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign recently completed a test 
of our emergency response and evacuation plans. The test included two 
components: a drill and an exercise. The drill (a test of our Illini-
Alert emergency notification system), was conducted on October 18, 2011 
at 10:00 am.  This drill was announced via a campus mass mail and Eweek 
notice.  The Illini-Alert system sent an email to the Illinois.edu 
addresses of all active faculty, staff, and students.  Those who have 
registered alternate email addresses also received an email 
notification.  Those who have registered a cell phone were sent a text 
message during this drill. 

In an attempt to increase the speed and breadth of emergency 
communications, the campus recently increased Illini-Alerts modes of 
emergency communication to include Facebook and Twitter.  This multi-
modal approach provides a robust communication engine that will continue 
to function successfully even if there is a failure of one mode of 
communication.
 
If you have not signed up to receive emergency messages through Illini-
Alert, please visit emergency.illinois.edu to register.   

The second component of the test was a tabletop exercise conducted on 
October 26, 2011 from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm at the Champaign County 
Emergency Operations Center.  The exercise was announced via a campus 
mass mail and Eweek notice.  The tabletop exercise involved multiple bomb 
threats including one device that detonated in a campus building.  The 
exercise scenario tested various components of the Campus Emergency 
Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures. 
 
Summary of Emergency Response Plan

The University Campus Emergency Operations Plan includes information 
regarding the roles and responsibilities of those operating in the campus 
Incident Command Post and Emergency Operation Center; operating status 
parameters; incident priorities and performance expectations; shelter-in-
place and evacuation guidelines; and local contingency and continuity 
planning requirements.  University departments are responsible for 
developing their own emergency action plans and continuity of operations 
plans for their staff and areas of responsibility.  The University 
conducts numerous emergency response exercises each year, such as 
tabletop exercises and tests of the emergency notification systems on 
campus.  These tests are designed to assess and evaluate emergency plans 
and capabilities of the institution. 

University of Illinois police officers and supervisors have received 
training on the National Incident Management System which includes use of 
the Incident Command System.  This federally mandated training is 
designed to assist first responders in responding to and managing 
critical incidents.  If a serious incident occurs that causes an 
immediate threat to campus, personnel from the University of Illinois 
Police Department, Urbana Police Department, Champaign Police Department, 
Urbana Fire Department, Champaign Fire Department, PRO Ambulance and 
ARROW Ambulance will usually be the first on scene.  Personnel from these 
agencies typically respond and work together to manage a critical 
incident.   Depending on the size, scope and seriousness of the incident, 
other University departments and/or other local or federal agencies could 
also be involved in the response.  

General information about the emergency response and evacuation 
procedures for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are 
publicized each year as part of our Clery Act compliance 
efforts.  The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Annual 
Security Report can be viewed at 
http://www.dps.illinois.edu/universitypolice/asr2010.pdf.  Additional 
information, including a copy of the Campus Emergency Operations Basic 
Plan, can be found at 
http://www.police.illinois.edu/emergencyplanning/ceop.html. 
 
Summary of Emergency Evacuation Procedures

Evacuation drills are coordinated by University Housing, Code Compliance 
and Fire Safety and local fire departments each semester for all 
University Residence Halls to ensure that emergency response and 
evacuation procedures are tested at least twice each year.  Students 
living in University Residence Halls learn the locations of emergency 
exits in the buildings and are provided guidance about the direction they 
should travel when exiting each facility for a short-term building 
evacuation.  Residents are not told in advance about the designated 
locations for long-term evacuations because those decisions are affected 
by time of day, location of the building being evacuated, the 
availability of the various designated emergency gathering locations on 
campus, and other factors such as the location and nature of the threat.  
In these cases, University Housing staff and/or first responders on scene 
will communicate information to students regarding the developing 
situation or any evacuation status changes.
 
The purpose of evacuation drills is to prepare building occupants for an 
organized evacuation in case of a fire or other emergency. At the 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, evacuation drills are used as 
a way to educate and train occupants on fire safety issues specific to 
their building.  Prior to conducting drills, University Housing residents 
are provided a brochure with emergency evacuation information.  
Additionally, evacuation routes are posted on the doors of resident hall 
rooms.  During drills, occupants practice procedures and familiarize 
themselves with the location of exits and the sound of the fire alarms.  
In addition to educating occupants about the evacuation procedures during 
the drills, the process also provides the University an opportunity to 
test the operation of fire alarm system components.

Evacuation drills are evaluated by University Housing staff, Code 
Compliance and Fire Safety and local fire departments to review egress 
and behavioral patterns.  Reports are prepared by participating 
departments that identify deficient equipment so that repairs can be made 
immediately.  Recommendations for improvements are also submitted to the 
appropriate departments/offices for consideration.

Students who reside in University Residence Halls receive information 
about evacuation and shelter-in-place procedures during their first floor 
meetings and during other educational sessions they can participate in 
throughout the year.  University Housing staff members are trained in 
these procedures as well and act as an on-going resource for the students 
living in residential facilities.

Shelter-in-Place Procedures 
What it Means to Shelter-in-Place

There may be emergencies that arise that do not afford individuals the 
opportunity to safety evacuate.  During these types of emergency 
situations, sheltering-in-place may be necessary.  Sheltering-in-place 
means to stay inside a known, safe area to avoid adverse conditions in an 
exterior environment.  Examples of emergencies where the shelter-in-place 
option may be necessary and/or preferred include severe weather (tornado) 
or an active shooter situation.  This may also include a fire emergency 
for persons with disabilities that are not able to leave the building on 
their own or if the elevator is recalled during a fire.

Basic Shelter-in-Place Guidance

If an incident occurs that does not present a safe opportunity to 
evacuate, find an immediate place of safety and stay there until it is 
safe to come out.  This may include locking the door(s) or barricading 
the ingress/egress point(s) of the area you are occupying.  It may also 
include covering the windows to decrease visibility of the occupied 
area.  

If an incident occurs where a shelter-in-place option is not possible, 
leave the area immediately following the evacuation procedures for your 
building.  Follow the directions of police and/or fire personnel if they 
are on scene of the incident.

How You Will Know to Shelter-in-Place

A shelter-in-place notification may come from several sources, including 
the University of Illinois Police Department (via the Illini-Alert 
emergency notification system), the Office of Public Affairs, other 
University employees, or other authorities utilizing the University?s 
emergency communications tools.

How to Shelter in-Place

If an incident occurs where sheltering-in-place is the best option, 
follow these steps, unless instructed otherwise by emergency personnel:

These steps should only be followed if safe to do so:

-Once aware of the emergency, seek or remain in a location deemed safe 
from the affected area.

-Once within a safe area, attempt to secure the space in whatever 
reasonable manner is applicable.

-Stay in the area of safety and remain quiet, unless making noise would 
be beneficial to your safety (i.e. rescue or recovery).

-Stay away from objects which may lead to an injury.

-Do not leave the area of safety until you are notified that the 
emergency is no longer a threat to personal safety.

The Division of Public Safety hopes this information is useful to all 
those who work, study and visit our campus community.  Best wishes for a 
safe and productive year.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Senate Bill 512, public pension funding","Dear Faculty and Staff,

As we approach the second half of the General Assembly's annual fall veto 
session, we're keeping a close eye on issues of concern to the University 
of Illinois.  One of those issues is public pension funding.  You may be 
seeing ads in the media promoting Senate Bill 512, legislation that 
proposes changes in pension funding for current employees that we believe 
would adversely affect the University and the state.  As I communicated 
with you last spring, I testified against this bill and it was not moved 
forward for action.  Many legislators were concerned by the potential 
adverse consequences of the bill, which I and others brought to their 
attention.

We continue to press for a solution to the state's pension funding 
concerns that doesn't unjustly place the entire burden on the backs of 
our hardworking employees. As part of this effort, I share with you the 
text of an Op-Ed I submitted to the Chicago Sun-Times, which was 
published this past Sunday.  It follows my sign off.  I encourage you to 
contact your legislators using your own personal e-mail and resources 
(i.e., non-university) to assert the importance of a fair solution and 
the problematic aspects of SB-512. I'll continue to keep you updated as 
the issue moves forward.

Sincerely,
Mike

Michael J. Hogan

University of Illinois
=================================================================

Op-Ed printed in the Sunday, October 30, 2011, edition of the Chicago Sun-
Times:

Cutting pensions would lead to U. of I. brain drain
By Michael J. Hogan

     It's easy to understand the Law of Unintended Consequences, the 
unanticipated and sometimes perverse effects of actions - sometimes 
government actions - that were ostensibly intended to provide a public 
good.
     Examples of this principle abound, but one that is often noted these 
days has to do with Senate Bill 512, now under discussion in Springfield, 
to fund the state's pension obligations to public employees.  Leaders in 
Illinois public higher education worry that the proposed solution could 
have unintended consequences of substantial proportions. Their employees, 
many ineligible for Social Security, would have to accept diminished 
benefits or ante up significantly more to maintain the benefits they were 
promised. 
     The likely effect of Senate Bill 512 in its current form will be a 
brain drain from these public universities and their surrounding 
communities.
     The University of Illinois is one of the largest and most productive 
employers in the state.  Twenty percent of our workforce is pension-
eligible and that includes some of our most distinguished faculty, 
physicians, and staff - many of whom would leave if onerous changes are 
made in the pension plan.
     Make no mistake about it, these outstanding and civic-minded 
employees have choices in a competitive market place not bound by 
geography. Those who leave may take their externally funded research 
projects worth millions of dollars with them and take their pension, 
too.  Replacing these employees with comparable talent will be difficult 
so long as other universities are offering better benefits.
     Such an exodus would devastate our ability to meet the U of I's 
teaching, research, public service, and health care missions, and would 
slam the brakes on what has consistently been a vibrant economic engine 
for this great state. 
     Among the top teaching and research universities in the world, the U 
of I and its three campuses directly and indirectly generates more than 
150,000 jobs and more than $13 billion in economic impact for Illinois, a 
return of $17 for every $1 that the state invests in the U of I.  We are 
the place that pioneered transistors, LED lighting, and MRI technology.  
We are the place that educated the founders of YouTube, PayPal and the 
NFL. None of this happens without great people. Entrepreneurial 
scientists pushing the boundaries of knowledge. Award-winning authors, 
artists and teachers, skilled health care professionals. Other 
universities in other states are hungry for this talent. We must work 
hard to retain them.
     But the proposed pension funding legislation will make it difficult 
to do that, and to recruit other highly professional faculty and staff. 
It will damage the public university system in Illinois, and in so doing, 
damage the state, as well.
       As we contemplate the state's strategic advantages, how does it 
help in the long term to reduce funding for higher education, including 
two public Tier One research campuses, and provide substantially less 
compensation to its talented workforce?  
     We know that a solution to the pension problem is urgently needed, 
and we are willing to contribute our fair share to an equitable 
solution.   But it needs to be based on the principles of equity and 
shared sacrifice, to which we can all contribute without doing great 
damage to the educational institutions central to the well being of our 
students and to the state's place in a knowledge-based economy.
     I urge legislators to consider the interests of our employees, the 
impact of their departure, and the threat that weakened public 
universities pose to the future of the state.  The potential consequences 
are far too great to ignore.

Michael J. Hogan is president of the University of Illinois.

 Subject: PUBLIC SAFETY BULLETIN","ASSISTANCE IN LOCATING OFFENDER FOR PERSONAL INJURY HIT AND RUN ACCIDENT

Sunday, October 30, 2011

The University of Illinois Police Department is requesting assistance 
from the University Community to locate and apprehend an offender who 
struck two females with a vehicle while they were in the crosswalk at the 
intersection of Fourth and Springfield in Champaign.  

On October 30, 2011 at approximately 2:17 a.m., the Champaign Police 
Department responded to the intersection of Fourth and Springfield for a 
hit and run accident involving two females who were struck in the 
crosswalk by a white vehicle.  The vehicle was described as a white 4-
door passenger car that left the scene westbound on Springfield Avenue 
from the accident.  The two pedestrians were transported to Carle 
Hospital with serious injuries and are still hospitalized.

From the preliminary investigation, the two females were walking 
northbound with a group of pedestrians in the west crosswalk of the 
intersection of Fourth and Springfield when the westbound white 4-door 
passenger car struck them.  Witnesses described the vehicle as slowing 
after striking them, and then running over them as the vehicle continued 
to flee the scene of the accident.

This investigation is continuing and the Champaign Police Department is 
working directly with the University of Illinois Police Department to 
apprehend this offender.  Both police agencies are currently analyzing 
security camera footage in the campus district to identify the offender 
and the vehicle involved in the hit and run accident.  

Anyone with information can contact the Champaign Police Department at 
217-351-4545 or the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-
1216.  Citizens can also anonymously call Crime Stoppers at 
(8477).  An anonymous web tip can be given at www.373tips.com or you can 
text keyword CCTIP plus the tip information to: 274637 (CRIMES).  Crime 
Stoppers will pay a reward up to $1000 for information leading to the

Dear Faculty, Staff and Students:

I am pleased to announce the appointment of Susan Kies as Secretary of 
the Board of Trustees and of the University, pending approval by the 
Board at its meeting on Dec. 2, 2011.

Susan has served as an administrator and as a faculty member on the 
Urbana-Champaign campus for nearly two decades and I am delighted to 
welcome her to her new role as secretary. Her duties will include 
planning for all Board and Board committee meetings, maintaining records 
of the board, publication of the transactions of the Board, maintaining 
the basic documents of the Board such as the University of Illinois 
Statutes, and working with trustees collectively and individually as they 
serve the University.

Since 2004, Susan has served as associate dean for academic 
affairs/curriculum development for the College of Medicine in Urbana-
Champaign, helping coordinate curriculum and providing faculty support 
for undergraduate medical education. Susan also serves as an adjunct 
associate professor in the Department of Internal Medicine and a clinical 
associate professor in the Department of Pathology in the College of 
Medicine. She earned her bachelor's degree from the Urbana-Champaign 
campus, and her master's and doctor of education degrees from Oklahoma 
State University. 

Susan will replace Michele Thompson, who will retire in January after 
more than 20 years as secretary. Michele has served the University with 
distinction and enormous grace, and I am deeply grateful for her loyalty, 
her professionalism and her tireless work ethic.

To ensure a smooth transition, Susan will begin her new duties, pending 
Board approval, as secretary-designate and will work alongside Michele 
for a few months.

I hope you will join me in welcoming Susan to her new position. Her 
leadership and vast knowledge are a perfect match for her new duties, and 
will serve our great university well.

Sincerely,

Mike

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Thanks for a Memorable Experience","Dear Faculty, Staff and Students:

As I transition from being the vice president for academic affairs to a 
full-time faculty member, I cannot help but express my thanks to all 
those who made the last 51 months a very special experience. I thank the 
board of trustees, led by three chairmen, and three presidents of the 
University, for providing me the opportunity to view and serve the 
University from a different vantage point.  I have interacted with nine 
chancellors and seven provosts over this period of time and I appreciate 
what they have taught me about leadership.  Their dedication to the 
mission of the academy is inspiring.  Kudos also go to my many wonderful 
colleagues in university administration and the campuses, faculty, staff 
and students, ranging from vice presidents to student help, whose 
patience and help were invaluable in my foray into administration.  The 
raison d'etre for doing this job is the people who make this institution 
buzz: the bright students and accomplished alums, the faculty who exude 
excitement about their scholarship, and the eager staff ready to make the 
place better, be it in Champaign-Urbana, Chicago or Springfield.  Thank 
you.   

But it was not all peaches and cream: the weekly back and forth on I-57, 
exit 297 and the Clifton Huey stop notwithstanding, was wearing.  In 
Urbana, a special thanks to all those who made the Union a home away from 
home for me: ""Meena at the Union"" may not have the same ring as ""Eloise 
at the Park Plaza Hotel,"" but sure had the same feel.  Be it the 
welcoming staff at the front desk and points beyond, or the students 
dashing out the door, backpack slung in an ergonomically incorrect 
fashion, iPod's securely plugged in their ears, clearly in their own 
world, suddenly doing a double take and returning to help this grey-
haired ""bag-laden"" lady manipulating those oh so handsome but oh so heavy 
doors.

In Chicago, a special thanks to my colleagues who were more than willing 
to take the time to help me get my eco-friendly wheels running, and to 
ensure that I was sufficiently caffeinated to hit the Dan Ryan at its 
best (yes, that does happen) and most challenging.  I would be remiss if 
I did not thank the patience of my lab group who kept the research 
simmering.  Now we can rev it up to full boil. 

Thanks to all my Springfield colleagues for the warm welcome, great 
conversations and the privilege of parking in the Tear Drop; who said 
parking was not coveted at UIS?

My gratitude and loads of good wishes to the individuals who make this 
University great.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Want changes to the campus bus system or to Safe R","To all Illinois Students:

The campus is currently preparing to renegotiate the contact with the 
Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District.  The campus has traditionally 
outsourced its responsibility to provide student bus services (including 
Safe Rides) to the MTD.  These renegotiations take place every three 
years, with any subsequent changes to the student Transportation Fee 
going before the student body for a vote during the Spring Student 
Elections, and then being forwarded to the University of Illinois Board 
of Trustees.

As the Student Representative to the C-U MTD Board of Trustees, I have 
the responsibility of representing the student body in these 
negotiations.  As such, I have organized three town hall meetings on the 
Transportation Fee in order to give you an opportunity to express your 
thoughts on campus MTD services.  These town halls will be held on:

Monday, October 10th at the Law School Auditorium from 7-8:30pm

Tuesday, October 11th at the Illini Union General Lounge (room 
210) from 12-1:30pm

Thursday, October 13th at the Illini Union General Lounge (room 
210) from 7-8:30pm

Representatives from the MTD will be in attendance to address questions 
and concerns at these times.

In addition to collecting information from these meetings, I invite you 
to submit your thoughts to me via the link below by October 21, 2011.  
This is your opportunity to suggest changes to the MTD campus system (bus 
system/Safe Rides), including the possible expansion/reduction of 
services, or the creation of new services.  Your name will not be 
released.

Please share your thoughts at:  https://illinois.edu/fb/sec/5649956

please feel free to contact me at maskeri1@illinois.edu

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Greetings from Chancellor Wise","Dear Campus Community:

This weekend during a host of exciting Homecoming activities, I began my 
new responsibilities as Vice President of the University of Illinois and 
Chancellor of the Urbana-Champaign campus. I feel deeply honored to have 
the opportunity to lead one of most highly respected research 
universities in the world. I am eager to begin working with all of you to 
make this university an even more outstanding institution of higher 
education.
 
Thanks to the leadership of Interim Vice President and Chancellor Bob 
Easter who, for two years, has successfully led this campus through a 
very challenging financial period, I take over a campus that is presently 
fiscally healthy and poised to maintain and even surpass its excellent 
record of teaching, research, and public engagement. No doubt we will 
continue - as all American public universities will - to face budgetary 
challenges due to the state's own financial tribulations, but we now have 
a framework in place that allows us to confront these challenges and keep 
us operating at the highest possible level of efficiency.
 
During my first few months, I will undertake a broad ""listening and 
learning tour"" meeting with faculty, students, and staff in small groups 
in different venues. I want to learn about what is important to you, what 
you are passionate about, what you believe makes the University 
distinctive, what our core values are, and what might need to change. 
This campus is highly respected both nationally and internationally 
because of what you do. Your passion, intellect, and drive have created a 
creative and vibrant culture of collaboration. I have long known that the 
Urbana-Champaign campus is an incubator for innovation that permeates all 
aspects of our activity. Through my listening and learning tour, I know I 
will learn more about this amazing institution.

We will be recruiting two key leadership positions: Provost and Vice 
Chancellor for Research. I am very grateful for the strong leadership 
that Interim Provost Richard Wheeler and Interim Vice Chancellor for 
Research Ravi Iyer have demonstrated during the past two years. We expect 
to be able to identify individuals who will continue and expand on this 
work for the longer term.

In closing, I ask for your support as we work together to build upon the 
distinguished history of achievement at this great university. I consider 
it an honor to lead us forward toward an even brighter future.

 Subject: Public Safety Bulletin","ASSISTANCE IN LOCATING REPEAT BURGLARY OFFENDER

Friday, September 30, 2011

The University of Illinois Police Department is requesting assistance 
from the University Community to locate and apprehend a repeat offender 
who is known to frequent our properties. Andra D. Brent has a long 
history of entering U of I building and committing daytime thefts from 
offices left unattended.

Brent was released/paroled from the Illinois Department of Corrections 
(IDOC) on September 15, 2011, and he was observed exiting a professors 
office in Turner Hall, 1102 S. Goodwin Ave. in Urbana on September 20th. 
An IDOC warrant of apprehension was generated and Brent was arrested on 
this warrant on September 24, 2011, in Champaign. At that time University 
of Illinois Police issued to Brent a Letter of No Trespass for all 
University property.

Brent was released from the Champaign County jail on September 24th after 
the arrest warrant was served. Brent violated his parole requirements 
after being released from IDOC by not reporting to his check-in location. 
Brent is currently in violation status for failure to report to the 
assigned location per his parole requirements, after being released from 
the county jail.

UIPD has responded to reports of Brent in Turner Hall after his last 
release and we believe we have camera record of his presence in the ACES 
Library. Although Brent frequents buildings on the Urbana side of campus 
he has been arrested in Champaign for similar crimes over the years. It 
is unknown as to the location Brent is staying and he might be residing 
close to the buildings he is frequently entering.
Please review this link to the UIPD website for a photograph of Andra 
Brent, descriptions and mannerisms. If you observe Brent please call 
police dispatch at 333-8911 and supply a clothing description, location 
and last known direction of travel. It is likely that he will change 
clothing while in the process of his criminal activities.

Name: Andra D. Brent

Sex: Male

Age: 47

Height: 5 feet, 11 inches

Weight: 170 pounds

Descriptors: Face has pockmarks or freckles, may carry folder or papers 
as prop and indicate he is looking for someone or looking for work, poor 
eye contact during conversation

 Subject: MASSMAIL - With Gratitude","Dear Colleagues:

As we complete preparations to transfer the Chancellor's responsibilities 
to incoming Chancellor Dr. Phyllis Wise, I want to take a moment to thank 
the campus community for the support and encouragement that I have 
received over the past two years. My appointment to the role of interim 
vice president of the University and chancellor of the Urbana-Champaign 
campus was an unanticipated change in career trajectory resulting from 
circumstances in which I take no joy.
 
This was a difficult period for our campus, exacerbated by the economic 
downturn and the state's lack of tax revenue needed to provide the 
financial support promised. But, it was also a period of extraordinary 
shared sacrifice by the campus community, a time in which faculty, 
professional and non-academic staff, students, alumni and donors came 
together in a successful effort to sustain our institution. Difficult 
decisions were made through the process of shared governance and with the 
support and encouragement of Presidents Ikenberry and Hogan and the Board 
of Trustees. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is 
financially stable at the moment and with potential for a future 
consistent with the legacy of past achievements that this campus has 
known in its 144-year history.

Throughout this time, it was truly a privilege to hold a position of 
leadership and to work daily with those making the tough choices 
necessary for our survival. Many deserve a word of thanks and, with the 
very real risk of inadvertently leaving out some individuals, I can only 
mention a few who hold major campus responsibilities: Interim Provost and 
Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, Dick Wheeler; Interim Vice 
Chancellor for Research Ravi Iyer; Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, 
Renee Romano; Vice Chancellor for Advancement, Jim Schroeder; Interim 
Vice Chancellor for Public Engagement, Steve Sonka; Executive Director of 
Facilities and Services, Jack Dempsey; Director of Public Safety, Barbara 
O'Connor; Director of the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics, Ron 
Guenther; and Robin Kaler, Associate Chancellor for Public Affairs.  
Special mention is due to Bill Adams, Chief of Staff in the Chancellor's 
Office; Mike Andrechak, Associate Chancellor and Associate Provost for 
Budgets and Resource Planning; Elyne Cole, Associate Provost for Human 
Resources; and Phyllis Mischo, Assistant to the Chancellor.

I would also acknowledge the significant leadership of deans, department 
heads, department chairs and directors of schools and institutes. 
Additionally, it was a privilege to work with the faculty governance 
process under the leadership of Senate Executive Committee Chair, Dr. 
Joyce Tolliver, and her successor Dr. Matt Wheeler. Finally, I would like 
to thank former Student President David Olsen for reminding me of our 
great student body, the reason we do what we do.

Perhaps the greatest personal reward during my time in the Chancellor's 
office has been the opportunity to meet individuals and to discover 
programs that were unknown to me even after 38 years of residence on the 
campus. After all this time I thought I knew this campus. I was mistaken. 
This is an even more incredible place than I ever imagined, permeated by 
an absolute commitment to excellence and creativity and sustained by a 
culture of mutual support and encouragement and an element of Midwestern 
egalitarianism where opinions and ideas are valued regardless of source.  
I was fortunate to work here and so are you.

I am confident of the future and look forward to the solid leadership 
that Chancellor Wise will provide.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - University-wide Climate Survey","Dear Faculty, Staff, and Students,

I am pleased to announce that on October 26, we will launch the first 
ever University-wide Climate Survey at the University of Illinois.  
Although several campus units have conducted targeted climate surveys, 
this new census survey will gauge all faculty, staff, and student 
perceptions of the University climate, building on earlier efforts in 
order to provide a benchmark for the University of Illinois. After the 
survey results are analyzed, the information gathered will be used to 
prioritize and implement necessary changes to improve climate. 
Additionally, the survey will be repeated every 2-3 years so that we stay 
abreast of changes and continue to transform the institutional climate.

Obtaining meaningful data will be dependent on a robust response rate. 
Thus, your participation is very important to the success of the survey. 
The census survey is web-based and is expected to take approximately 10-
15 minutes to complete. Data collection and analysis will be conducted by 
the Survey Research Laboratory.  Your responses will be confidential. 

A website has been established to provide more information about the 
survey and to answer any questions you may have.  To learn more about the 
survey and read responses to frequently asked questions: 


The university-wide survey is vital to help us further the diversity and 
climate initiatives that are central to our institution. I thank you in 
advance for participating in this important endeavor.

Re:	Stewarding Excellence @ Illinois

We write to update you on some of our Stewarding Excellence@Illinois 
activities.

We have made progress regarding scholarship and waiver policies and 
practices on our campus.  In our September 2010 Next Steps Letter 
regarding the Refocusing Scholarships Project Team report, we identified 
three essential tasks to be completed:

launching a fundraising initiative focused on meeting the growing unmet 
financial needs of our students;

creating a campus policy that establishes our priorities and guides our 
waiver and scholarship program; and

improving coordination of campus and unit level scholarship and waiver 
offers.

We are pleased to report that as a campus we have moved forward on all 
three of these important tasks.  In October 2010, the campus launched an 
Undergraduate Scholarship Initiative.  The Council of Deans created a 
Scholarship/Financial Aid Implementation Working Group to make 
recommendations that were used to support and implement that major 
scholarship initiative.  Similarly, the Offices of Student Financial Aid, 
Undergraduate Admissions and the Provost's Office worked together to 
draft a campus Undergraduate Scholarship and Waiver Policy, which we have 
adopted.  Finally, a campus-wide Scholarship Committee is being formed to 
address scholarship coordination issues.  For more information regarding 
these reports and the Undergraduate Scholarship and Waiver policy, please 
visit:  

http://oc.illinois.edu/budget/nextsteps.html
http://www.osfa.illinois.edu/aid/scholarships/undergrad_policy.html

We would also like to update you on the work of the Stewarding 
Excellence@Illinois Facilities and Services (F&S) Project Team.  The 
team's charge was most certainly an ambitious one, especially given the 
size and scope of F&S, the services it provides across campus, and the 
time allotted for this review.  We are grateful to the Project Team for 
its efforts to examine several aspects of F&S including its funding, 
structure, and policies.  After consultation with key stakeholders and 
after significant internal deliberation, the Project Team concluded that 
its work should be continued as a lengthier and more comprehensive 
review, possibly aided by an external consultant.  We concur with this 
approach.  To this end, we will charge a new team outside of the 
Stewarding Excellence process to examine F&S in greater detail.  We are 
encouraged by the willingness of some of the Project Team members to 
serve in this capacity, and we will reach out to them as soon as the new 
team is constituted.  We have posted a report that summarizes the project 
team's work and its recommendation that a more extensive review take 
place.  The report can be found at 
http://oc.illinois.edu/budget/projectteams.html. We will keep the campus 
apprised of our progress as we move forward.

 Subject: University taking swift action ","
September 12, 2011

Dear Members of the Urbana-Champaign Campus Community,

This past weekend, the University disclosed that it is conducting an 
inquiry into possible inaccuracies in student profile data concerning the 
incoming College of Law class of 2014 that had been publicly posted and 
distributed. 

Let me assure you that this matter is being taken very seriously by the 
highest levels of the University, the campus, and the College of Law.  
With the support of the Board of Trustees, I have asked the University 
Ethics Office and the Office of the University Counsel to lead the 
inquiry.  To guarantee that our review has complete integrity, they will 
be assisted by an independent data analysis firm and external legal 
counsel familiar with the University and its data-reporting requirements.

The data in question -- median law school entrance test scores and grade 
point averages for the class of 2014 -- have been removed from the 
College's website and the University will provide the accurate data as 
soon as it is verified.

Although many questions remain to be answered, the action by the 
University has been swift and thorough since Aug. 26 when the Ethics 
Office received credible information that prompted the review. 
Administrative staff at the College are cooperating fully with the 
inquiry. The College community and alumni, as well as the general public 
, were notified 
over the weekend. A report on the findings and outcome of the inquiry 
will be forthcoming at its conclusion.

This is unpleasant news and is apt to disappoint, even anger, anyone who 
hears it. At the same time, however, we can also say that a new culture 
has taken hold at our University. A tone of integrity and transparency is 
apparent across all of our campuses, and people are no longer reluctant 
to come forward.  We take questionable actions seriously and review them 
thoroughly and expeditiously. 

You have my assurance, and the assurance of Urbana campus leadership, 
that we will investigate any credible report of unethical behavior. We 
all are proud of our part in making -- and keeping -- the University of 
Illinois a strong and ethical institution.
 
Mike

I am pleased to announce the appointment of Christophe Pierre to the 
University of Illinois as the Vice President for Academic Affairs, 
pending approval by the Board of Trustees at its September 9, 2011, 
meeting.

Dr. Pierre comes to us from McGill University in Montreal, where he has 
served as dean of the Faculty of Engineering since 2005. Prior to joining 
McGill he held engineering faculty and administrative appointments at 
the University of Michigan for two decades. He holds a bachelor's degree 
in aerospace engineering from Ecole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures de 
Paris in France, a master's degree in mechanical and aerospace 
engineering from Princeton University, and a doctorate in mechanical 
engineering and materials science from Duke University. 

I am delighted to welcome such an accomplished scholar and administrator 
to our University. Dr. Pierre's dedication and vision led him to advance 
the quality and stature of programs at McGill University's Faculty of 
Engineering. He was active in raising more than $50 million for the 
school and was instrumental in increasing enrollment, research funding, 
and faculty. In the six years that he served as dean, the number of 
engineering doctoral fellowships awarded rose exponentially from 
eight to 128.

I would like to thank the members of the search advisory committee, 
chaired by Dr. Robert Easter, interim vice president and chancellor 
of the Urbana-Champaign campus, for their unwavering commitment to 
this search.

Dr. Pierre is scheduled to begin his U of I position, pending Board 
approval, on October 16, 2011. 

I hope you will join me in welcoming Dr. Pierre to our University. 
I know that, like me, you will look forward to his leadership as we 
work together to further advance academic programs across our campuses.

OCCURRED:   August 20, 2011, approximately 1:40 am 
 
LOCATIONS:  1109 S Lincoln Avenue, Urbana
 
BRIEF DETAILS:
 
Robbery 
 
The University of Illinois Police Department is investigating a robbery 
that occurred on August 20, 2011 at approximately 1:40 a.m. between 
McKinley Health Center and the Illini Grove (1109 S Lincoln Avenue, 
Urbana).  The crime was reported by the victim on August 20, 2011 at 
approximately 3:00 a.m.
 
The victim was walking between McKinley Health Center and the Illini 
Grove when he heard an individual ask him what he was doing and told him 
to come over to the Illini Grove.  When the victim looked, he saw two 
male individuals standing in the Illini Grove.  As the victim approached, 
Offender 1 asked him how much money he had on him.  Offender 1 then 
demanded the victims money and stated, Do not make this any more 
difficult than it has to be.  The victim gave Offender 1 his cash.  
Offender 1 instructed the victim to turn around, walk away and told the 
victim that he did not want to see any blue lights or hear any sirens. 
The victim did not see which way the offenders fled.
 
OFFENDER DESCRIPTIONS:
 
Offender 1, whom the victim had seen before in campus town, is described 
as a black male, approximately 6 feet 2 inches tall, 180 lbs., between 25-
30 years old, with facial hair, wearing a black shirt and black pants. 
Offender 2, is described as a black male, approximately 40 years old, 
with salt and pepper hair and a grizzled beard, wearing a grey hoodie, 
blue jeans, and white shoes.
 
Information about the race or ethnicity of alleged offenders is provided 
only to aid detailed descriptions that include physical stature, clothing 
or unusual characteristics.  Racial descriptions do not by themselves 
offer a meaningful picture of an offenders appearance.
 
POLICE RESPONSE:
 
The University of Illinois Police Department continues to actively work 
to identify and apprehend the offenders in this incident.  Witnesses to 
this event or those with information are encouraged to contact the 
University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216.

Re:	Reaffirmation of Equal Employment Opportunity

At the start of each academic year, I have the privilege of reaffirming 
the University of Illinois' commitment to equal opportunity, consistent 
with University policy and federal and state regulations. 

The University, as reflected by Inclusive Illinois, is committed to 
creating and maintaining a community that recognizes and values the 
inherent worth and dignity of every person, while fostering an 
environment of mutual respect among its members.  The University takes 
seriously our responsibility to provide leadership in ensuring that equal 
employment opportunity is our standard practice rather than an 
aspiration.  As such, University policy prohibits discrimination or 
harassment of any member of the campus community during any stage of the 
employment process.  This includes recruitment, selection, promotion, 
transfer, merit increases, salary, training and development, demotion, 
and separation on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national 
origin, ancestry, age, order of protection status, genetic information, 
marital status, disability, sexual orientation including gender identity 
and unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected 
veteran.  Our policy is available online at 
http://oeoa.illinois.edu/campusconduct.html.  

Additionally, the University remains committed to the principles of 
affirmative action and equal access for women, minorities, persons with 
disabilities, and protected veterans.  The Campus Affirmative Action Plan 
describes the policies and procedures that must be followed in 
furtherance of these principles.  All employees are responsible for 
promoting equal employment opportunity and for making good faith efforts 
to achieve the university's affirmative action goals.  

The Office of Equal Opportunity and Access (OEOA) is a resource for the 
campus in matters of equal opportunity, affirmative action, and 
nondiscrimination in employment.  OEOA is available to address any campus 
concerns involving these matters. As always, we welcome and encourage 
your commitment to a respectful living, learning, and working community 
at Illinois.

Re:	Stewarding Excellence @ Illinois

As we close out the 2010-2011 academic year, while looking forward to the 
return of our students, I wanted to point with pride to what we have 
accomplished.  All across our campus, administrators, faculty, staff and 
students came together and addressed the challenges and uncertainties 
presented to us.  Every campus unit was called upon to make difficult 
fiscal, programmatic, procedural and other decisions necessary to ensure 
that we were able to best serve our students and fulfill our educational, 
research and outreach missions.  Despite additional cuts to state 
funding, our collective efforts have equipped the campus with the 
resources to reinvest in the critically important areas of a campus 
salary program, faculty hiring, physical infrastructure and other core 
initiatives.  

The Stewarding Excellence @ Illinois initiative was a significant part of 
the collaborative effort to address the unprecedented fiscal challenges 
facing the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and to do so in a 
way that continues and enhances our stature as a world-class institution. 

Please take the time to go to the following link to read more about our 
accomplishments and about recent personnel changes.  Again, I want to 
thank each and every one of you for your efforts.

individuals on the sidewalk.  Two of the individuals stayed in front of 
the victim while the third circled behind him.  One of the offenders  
displayed a small black hand gun and demanded the victims property. The 
victim gave the offender some of his personal belongings. The offenders 
told the victim to walk south on the sidewalk, and told him not to look 
back. The victim did not see which way the offenders fled.

On August 2, 2011 at approximately 11:00 pm the victim, at the bike rack

male and was possibly wearing a red shirt.

Information about the race or ethnicity of alleged offenders is provided 
only to aid detailed descriptions that include physical stature, clothing 
or unusual characteristics.  Racial descriptions do not by themselves 
offer a meaningful picture of an offenders appearance.

POLICE RESPONSE:

The University of Illinois and Urbana Police Departments continue to 
actively work to identify and apprehend the offenders in these 
incidents.  Witnesses to these events or those with information are 
encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-
333-1216 or the Urbana Police Department at 217-384-2320.

SAFETY INFORMATION:

Members of the campus community are strongly encouraged to follow these 
safety tips to decrease their potential for becoming a victim:
-Stay alert - call the police immediately to report suspicious activity.
-Trust your instincts - if it does not feel right, call for help.
-Avoid walking alone at night.  Travel in groups when possible and always 
walk in well-lit, heavily traveled areas. 
-Turn down your electronic devices. Excessive volume or use of electronic 
devices (iPods, PDAs, cell phones, etc.) can distract you from potential 
safety hazard.
-Drink responsibly - remember your ability to respond is diminished by 
over-consumption of alcohol.

 Subject: Phyllis Wise named to lead Urbana-Champaign campus","Dear Colleagues,

Today, I'm delighted to inform you that Phyllis M. Wise, Ph.D., provost 
and executive vice president at the University of Washington, has been 
selected to serve as the next Vice President of the University of 
Illinois and Chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign. Dr. Wise will join Urbana-Champaign effective October 1, 
pending Board of Trustees approval.

Dr. Wise has a proven record of scientific accomplishment and 
administrative leadership at the University of Washington, the University 
of California-Davis, and the University of Kentucky, among other 
institutions. She's a stellar advocate for public research universities, 
with an appreciation for our multi-faceted mission, which encompasses 
teaching, research, public service, and economic development. 

Prior to her appointment as provost and executive vice president at the 
University of Washington, Dr. Wise was the university's interim vice 
president from 2010-2011 (stepping away temporarily from her post as 
provost, which she held since 2005). From 2002-2005, she served as Dean 
of the College of Biological Sciences at UC Davis. She comes to us with 
over three decades of experience in research and higher education, 
earning her B.A. in Biology from Swarthmore, and her M.A. and Ph.D. in 
Zoology from the University of Michigan. Dr. Wise is a member of the 
National Academies of Science (Internal Medicine) and a fellow in the 
American Association for the Advancement of Science. She has a remarkable 
record of scientific accomplishment that includes more than 200 
scientific publications and an impressive record of over 30 years of 
continuous funding for her research. Additional information about Dr. 
Wise and this announcement can be found at:  

http://www.uillinois.edu/UrbanaChancellorSearch/

Dr. Wise will be introduced to our community on Tuesday, August 9, at 3 
p.m. in the South Lounge of the Illini Union.

Following her introduction, a welcome reception will take place from 4 to 
6 p.m. at the President's House (711 W. Florida Av., Urbana). I hope you 
will join me at both the introduction and the reception to welcome Dr. 
Wise and celebrate her appointment with me.

Let me take this opportunity to thank our search advisory committee, led 
by Professor Doug Beck. The committee recruited an outstanding pool of 
candidates and I'm grateful for their work. 

Also, let me note the tremendous gratitude we have for Interim Vice 
President and Chancellor Bob Easter who has led the campus during the 
last 1-1/2 years. Bob has been a friend and colleague to us all, and most 
important, an outstanding and compassionate leader. He will remain with 
us as interim vice president and chancellor until Dr. Wise's appointment 
begins on October 1, after which time, he plans to retire. I know that 
he'll always remain an engaged advocate for our great University.

Please join me in welcoming Dr. Phyllis Wise to our Urbana-Champaign 
campus.

Dear Colleagues:
 
At the January 20, 2011 meeting, the Board of Trustees approved an 
amended Policy on Conflicts of Commitment and Interest, effective July 1, 
2011.  The new policy will ensure that the University of Illinois is well 
positioned to meet the increasing complexity of conflict management in 
the 21st century.
 
The amended policy replaces the previous version, which has been in 
effect since 1996.  We received thoughtful input from many stakeholders 
and we are grateful to the many faculty and staff across the three 
campuses and university administration who were involved in carefully 
amending the policy.  With the creation of the new office of the Vice 
President for Research, President Hogan has transferred the authority for 
administering the Policy to the Vice President for Research, Lawrence B. 
Schook, from that of the Vice President for Academic Affairs, Mrinalini 
C. Rao.
 
The amended policy, frequently asked questions, the form and instructions 
for the report of non-university activities and contact information can

 Subject: Recognition of good work","Dear Colleagues,  

We've faced many challenges in recent years and I deeply appreciate how 
hard you've all been working throughout these difficult times.  I've 
stated all year that one of my top priorities has been to avoid furlough 
days and strive to find enough cost savings to restore merit-based 
compensation programs.

I'm pleased to announce that our cost-savings measures and careful 
planning on all our campuses has helped us in this regard.  We've been 
able to identify funding to enable the first campus salary program for 
our faculty and academic professionals in nearly three years.  This 
program authorizes the chancellors on each campus to use 3.0% of the 
salary pool for merit-based compensation adjustments.  The same program 
will be implemented for the University Administration.  This modest 
allocation is well-deserved for our hardworking employees who have faced 
salary freezes for consecutive years, as well as effective compensation 
losses in FY 2010 as a result of furlough days. 

Many of our collective bargaining units have contractual language that 
provides for pay adjustments based on the campus wage program, if the 
campus wage program is greater than previously negotiated pay adjustments 
for the same period.  I will, of course, honor those agreements.  For any 
negotiated groups that do not have such considerations in their 
contracts, the University will be willing to explore similar arrangements 
for this time period. 

I couldn't be more proud of our great University, which is made possible 
by our outstanding faculty and staff, who have worked hard to continue to 
make this university the best it can be.  We still have challenges ahead, 
but I know that by working together, continuing to streamline our 
administration and cut costs, we will continue to become stronger than 
ever.

Once more, I thank you for your commitment to the University and your 
ongoing support for our efforts to streamline operations and save costs, 
while also improving our programs.

Sincerely,

Mike

OCCURRED:   June 7, 2011, approximately 2:26 am

LOCATION:   200 Block East John, Champaign

BRIEF DETAILS:

The Champaign Police Department is investigating an aggravated robbery 
that occurred in the area of the 200 block of East John Street, Champaign.
  
On June 7, 2011 at approximately 2:26 a.m. the victim was walking on the 
north side of the sidewalk in the 200 block of East John Street. The 
victim observed an individual step out from between 212 East John and the 
parking garage west of that location. The individual then approached the 
victim with a black handgun in his right hand. The offender then asked 
the victim for his belongings and the victim pulled out his wallet and 
his cell phone and dropped them on the ground. The offender retrieved the 
wallet and cell phone and walked north between the west side of 212 East 
John Street and the parking garage. 

OFFENDER DESCRIPTIONS:

The offender is described as a black male, approximately 21 years of age, 
5 foot 7 inches tall, weighing 145-150 lbs.  The offender had dreadlocks 
just below his ears. The offender was wearing a white form fitting shirt 
which appeared to look like a soccer jersey.  The offender was also 
wearing shorts.

 Subject: VP of Health Affairs appointment recommended","Dear Colleagues,

Since Joe G.N. ""Skip"" Garcia joined the University of Illinois last year 
as the UIC Vice Chancellor for Research, he has met and consistently 
exceeded the high aspirations he sets for himself and his team, as well 
as the expectations of our Board of Trustees, his colleagues on the 
Chicago campus and the University administration.

Dr. Garcia's performance as interim Vice President for Health Affairs 
since last February has been equally impressive, and so it is with great 
satisfaction and confidence that I am recommending Skip to become VP-
Health Affairs on a permanent basis. The Board of Trustees will consider 
this recommendation when it meets next week on the Chicago campus, and 
pending trustees' approval the appointment will be effective June 16.

The University's health sciences clinical enterprise is an essential 
component of our health care, education, research and public engagement 
missions. It operates in a highly competitive environment in the Chicago 
area and other regions of the state, and it requires strong, visionary 
and stable leadership. I consulted with faculty advisory groups, UIC 
campus leaders and trustees, and a consensus emerged that we should move 
forward with a permanent VP-Health Affairs and that Dr. Garcia is the 
ideal person for the job.

His expertise and leadership are in high demand, and it was evident why 
when Dr. Garcia last week outlined a plan for the future of the 
University of Illinois' statewide health care enterprise at two forums on 
the UIC campus.

(http://tigger.uic.edu/depts/ovcr/research/events/townhall/index.html)

From leveraging our exceptional research capabilities to provide academic 
quality health care at multiple points in underserved communities, to 
rebranding our assets, it is clear that Skip has an aspirational and 
practical strategic plan for advancing the excellence and performance of 
the University's health care enterprise.
  
Before joining the University of Illinois at Chicago as Vice Chancellor 
for Research in 2010, Dr. Garcia served as the Director of the Division 
of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Johns Hopkins University (1998-
2005) and subsequently as the Chair of the Department of Medicine at the 
University of Chicago for four years. He is the Earl M. Bane Professor of 
Medicine, Pharmacology and Bioengineering at UIC. I hope you will join me 
in congratulating Dr. Garcia on the rapid advancement he is already 
making in our clinical enterprise and on his pending appointment to this 
key leadership position for the University of Illinois.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Legislative Testimony Update","Dear Colleagues,

As we enter the closing days of the state legislative session, I thought 
it important to give you an update about an issue I know many of you are 
following closely -- pension funding legislation.

Let me begin by saying that we've worked very hard to share both our 
concerns about this bill and our interest in working with legislators to 
find solutions to the many challenges that the State of Illinois faces. 
This spirit of candor about the adverse effects of the pension funding 
bill being considered, alongside recognition that the General Assembly is 
working very hard on extremely challenging problems is, I think, a fair 
balance to strike. Yet, the current legislation under consideration 
places the burden of pension funding on the backs of our employees, who 
have made their contributions to the system for many years in good faith. 
I don't see this as a fair and balanced solution to this challenge before 
the State.

On Thursday, we were disappointed when the House Committee on Pensions 
and Personnel voted to advance a bill on pension funding to the House 
floor that would have negative consequences for our employees.

I was invited to testify Thursday morning prior to the Committee vote and 
did so as the only public university president at the hearing. You can 
find my testimony at 
http://www.uillinois.edu/president/speeches/2011/May26.pensions.cfm. 
There were other constituencies that joined us in testifying against the 
bill. Despite the outcome, we were heartened by comments from some 
Committee members that called attention to the serious negative 
consequences of the legislation, especially concerns related to the 
retention and recruitment of our exceptionally talented state employees --
 a point I highlighted in my testimony.  

In the coming day or so, the bill will be debated on the House floor. 
Should the bill advance through the House, the next step will entail 
consideration in the Senate. Even if it proceeds through the Senate and 
is signed into law, there will be constitutional challenges.

I want to assure you that we will continue to work hard to make the case 
that it is not in the State's best interest to risk its most precious 
resource -- our highly accomplished faculty and staff at one of the 
world's best institutions, the University of Illinois.  

I hope that you, too, are weighing in with your own personal opinions 
about this legislation as citizens of the great State of Illinois.  
(Please note that, in doing so, State law does not allow you to use your 
University of Illinois e-mail, stationery, or telephone; instead, you 
must use your personal communication resources as a citizen of the State.)

Let me close by noting how proud I was to represent the University of 
Illinois on Thursday, as I am each and every day. What is perhaps most 
gratifying is the acknowledgment from others in the halls of our State 
Capitol regarding how important the University is -- how important you 
are -- to the future of the State.

Sincerely,

Mike

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Illinois AD Ron Guenther to Retire","Fighting Illini Icon Ron Guenther Retires After 19 Years as Athletics 
Director

Illinois Director of Athletics Ron Guenther announced today his 
retirement upon the completion of his contract on June 30. The longest-
tenured athletics director in the Big Ten, Guenther leaves the position 
after 19 highly successful years in which Fighting Illini teams captured 
34 Big Ten Championships, made a men's basketball Final Four appearance 
and made six football bowl appearances. He also made an impression 
nationally as a member of the BCS Football Committee since its inception, 
as a member of the Bowl Certification Committee for seven years and as a 
member of the NCAA Championships Cabinet.

""After giving considerable thought I have made the decision not to extend 
my contract as Athletic Director and will retire on July 1, 2011,"" 
Guenther said. ""For the last several months, I have been working with 
Chancellor Easter and administration on a succession plan for my 
position. A search committee is being formed and will begin work 
immediately to find my successor. I am confident an outstanding leader 
can be in place by mid-to-late summer.

""The last 19 years have gone extremely fast and a decision to retire has 
been very difficult. I personally want to thank all the members of the 
DIA as well as our colleagues in the academic community for their 
support. I have been fortunate to work with an extremely talented and 
loyal group. I will always be indebted. Additionally, the Illinois fan 
base is the best in the nation. I've always said we are fortunate to have 
individuals who have great passion and loyalty for the University of 
Illinois.""

In fact, few in the history of the UI leave a legacy as long and deep as 
Guenther. Under his tenure, the UI made unprecedented strides in 
facilities, with the $121 million Memorial Stadium Renaissance project 
becoming the biggest construction project in the history of the 
institution. Other major facilities completed while Guenther was 
athletics director includes the Irwin Indoor Football Facility, the Ubben 
Basketball Practice Facility, the Irwin Academic Center, Illinois Field 
for baseball, the UI Outdoor Track and Field and Soccer Stadium, the 
Atkins Tennis Center, the Khan Outdoor Tennis Complex, the Demirjian Golf 
Facility, Eichelberger Softball Field and the Irwin Football Complex, 
housing coaches offices, locker rooms, sports medicine, strength and 
conditioning facilities and meeting rooms for Illini football.

Long considered one of the nation's top athletics fundraisers, Guenther 
has been instrumental in soliciting gift commitments totaling more than 
$300 million toward capital improvements at Illinois during the last 19 
years. Endowment fundraising under Guenther's leadership has gone from $2 
million invested to more than $40 million in 2011, with an additional $40 
million pledged. In the same fashion, the annual fund has grown from $2.4 
million to nearly $8 million this year. As a member of the UI Library 
Brilliant Futures Campaign steering committee, he initiated a $1 million 
gift from the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics to the campaign.

As the Director of Athletics, Guenther demanded a culture of unbending 
integrity. The first item on the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics 
Mission Statement is just that - Integrity. He also stressed fiscal 
responsibility, with the DIA finishing in the black the final 17 years of 
his tenure. Guenther was named the NACDA/Continental Airlines Central 
Region Athletic Director of the Year in 2001.

""During his tenure as athletic director, Ron Guenther has transformed 
Illinois athletics to a perennial Top 20 program that is known for its 
integrity,"" said interim Vice President and Chancellor Bob Easter. ""Under 
Ron's leadership, our athletic facilities have become state-of-the-art 
and our programs to support student-athletes as scholars have become 
second to none. His achievements are world-class in every area - from a 
national champion runner-up basketball finish in 2005 to a 'Program of 
Excellence' award for the CHAMPS/Life Skills program to the Illinois 
Renaissance renovation of Memorial Stadium. Ron has been an exemplary 
leader, and our students will benefit from his vision for years to come.""

Guenther began his career as an Illini football player in 1963 as a 
freshman on the Big Ten championship squad featuring Dick Butkus and Jim 
Grabowski that went on to win the Rose Bowl. He went on to earn team Most 
Valuable Player honors as a senior in 1966, when he also was named second-
team All-Big Ten as an offensive guard. He also was named first-team 
Academic All-Big Ten honors and recognition as the University's 
outstanding senior in physical education.

Guenther was named the 17th Director of Athletics on May 14, 1992, after 
serving two years with the UI Foundation as Director of Major Gifts. His 
career also includes eight years at North Central College in Naperville, 
Ill, including a stint from 1975-79 as director of admissions and also as 
an associate head football coach. From 1979-83, he served as the vice 
president of development and public affairs at North Central. As 
associate head football coach, Guenther helped the Cardinals amass a 23-
12-2 record, including the school's first winning season in 15 years.

Before moving to North Central College, Guenther was the offensive line 
coach at Boston College from 1971-74, helping develop nine NFL players. 
From 1968-71, Guenther was a teacher and coached football, wrestling and 
track and field for the Evanston Township and Glenbard High School 
systems in suburban Chicago.

A native of Elmhurst, Ill., and a graduate of York High School, he 
lettered at Illinois in 1965 and 1966, helping Illinois to a 24-14-1 
record in his four seasons. Guenther earned team MVP honors on a squad 
that produced five All-Americans in 1966. He was inducted into the 
Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.

LOCATION:   505 East University Avenue, Champaign
 
BRIEF DETAILS:
 
The Champaign Police Department is investigating an armed robbery that 
occurred at Advance America, (505 East University Avenue, Champaign).
 
On May 13, at approximately 3:21 pm, an individual entered Advance 
America and pointed a handgun at an employee.  The offender took an 
undisclosed amount of money from the store and left southbound on foot 
into the campus district.  Based on the initial investigation, it is 
believed the offender eventually ran west from the area, entered a 
vehicle (unknown description) and left the campus district.   

Due to the fact the offender was running further into the campus district 
armed with a handgun, the University of Illinois Police Department 
disseminated an Illini-Alert message to inform the campus community of a 
verified, imminent threat to their safety.  Subsequent Illini-Alert 
messages were sent advising the community of the offender description and 
later that he was believed to have left the campus district.   

OFFENDER DESCRIPTIONS:
 
The offender is described as a black male, approximately 5'10"" tall, 
clean shaven with short hair.  The offender was wearing a black cap, sun 
glasses with gold trim, a black shirt with an unknown graphic, unknown 
colored jeans and a back pack.
 
Information about the race or ethnicity of alleged offenders is provided 
only to aid detailed descriptions that include physical stature, clothing 
or unusual characteristics.  Racial descriptions do not by themselves 
offer a meaningful picture of an offenders appearance. 
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 
The University of Illinois, Champaign and Urbana Police Departments are 
collaborating to provide CrimeReports, a national crime mapping service, 
with up-to-date crime information.  This map includes Clery crimes 
(homicide, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, arson 
and motor vehicle theft), as well as other crimes that are of concern to 
community members.

SAFETY INFORMATION:
 
Members of the campus community are strongly encouraged to follow these 
safety tips to decrease their potential for becoming a victim:

-Stay alert - call the police immediately to report suspicious activity.
-Trust your instincts - if it does not feel right, call for help.
-Avoid walking alone at night.  Travel in groups when possible and always 
walk in well-lit, heavily traveled areas. 
-Turn down your electronic devices. Excessive volume or use of electronic 
devices (iPods, PDAs, cell phones, etc.) can distract you from potential 
safety hazard.
-Drink responsibly - remember your ability to respond is diminished by 
over-consumption of alcohol.

Thu May 12 2011,20110512091638-011177,"      To: All Faculty & All Academic Professionals & All Civil Service Staff &
           All Undergrad Students & All Grad Students <everybody@illinois.edu>

 Subject: President's Update & Message of Appreciation","Dear Colleagues,

As the academic year winds down, I'd like to share my appreciation with 
you and update you on the important work we're doing together. As our 
commencements conclude, it's a time of celebration and hope, yet a 
bittersweet moment as we watch our graduates leave us for wonderful 
careers and great futures all over the world. Our graduates are among 
those most sought by employers and among those who give the most back to 
their communities. I'm proud of each of them and of the dedicated faculty 
and staff who have prepared them for their lives ahead. 

We have many other successes to celebrate, too. Our campuses, faculty, 
staff, and students continue to garner national and international acclaim 
for their accomplishments. Our Foundation is completing its 
successful ""Brilliant Futures"" campaign, which pledges more than $2.3 
billion in new support to our University. Our research portfolio is 
growing. And more students than ever are applying for admission, 
demonstrating again the high regard for the University of Illinois. We 
should never lose sight of the tremendous accomplishments of our faculty, 
staff, and students - the innovative discoveries and many contributions 
they make to a better future for people all over the world. We are strong 
and resilient, the economic crisis we face today will pass, and we will 
emerge better than ever. 

Yet, we do need to recognize the challenges still ahead. When I visit 
with faculty and staff, I hear concerns about pension and benefits. I 
continue to communicate with leadership in the General Assembly and to 
our legislators how important it is for the state to fulfill its 
commitment to our employees on the pension front. We've also been in 
direct contact with the director of the Illinois Department of Healthcare 
and Family Services on attempts to eliminate Health Alliance as a 
healthcare option for our current employees and retirees. See 
. We've communicated that 
thousands of University employees and retirees would be negatively 
affected by such an action, and there's good reason to believe that costs 
would actually increase for the state. Our legislators are listening and 
we're gaining more support for our position with every passing day.

Another area is procurement, where we've taken a lead role in preparing a 
document explaining the extensive costs of new regulatory requirements to 
universities and the state in terms of lost contracts, declining 
competitiveness, and the loss of precious time and effort. We recognize 
the importance of fair, legal, and ethical procurement practices. But 
many of the new regulatory burdens cost the state millions in lost 
opportunities for the best possible value and service and are undermining 
participation by vendors, especially small businesses and minority-owned 
firms. We've presented compelling evidence, and our legislators are 
interested in working with us on solutions.

Another concern involves ""position exemption authority"" from the State 
Universities Civil Service System, under which the University determines 
if a position is classified as civil service or academic professional, 
within criteria set forth by state statute. We've made some mistakes, 
which we're resolved to correct and avoid in the future. A bill 
introduced in the Senate (SB 1150), however, would remove this authority 
and undermine our ability to make appointments in response to rapidly 
arising academic and research needs. The bill is now in the House and we 
are working closely with representatives to communicate the unique 
employment situation at the University and the importance of retaining 
our position-exemption authority.

There are other issues we're weighing in on, including the ""concealed 
carry"" legislation (HB 148). We've helped draft amendments that can 
exempt parts of our campuses from the carrying of concealed weapons, 
should this legislation pass.  Another is the Illinois DREAM Act (SB 
2185). This bill will provide greater support to our undocumented 
students. As we know, students admitted to the University of Illinois, 
whether documented or undocumented, are among the nation's brightest. And 
like all of our graduates, they go on to stellar careers and become tax-
paying citizens and contributors to our economy and society. It's 
important for us, as a nation of immigrants, to ensure that the most 
precious resources our state has - bright minds - are not closed off from 
reaching their potential. 

I've had many opportunities to speak directly with Governor Pat Quinn, 
House Speaker Michael Madigan, and Senate President John Cullerton on 
these and other issues. I'm grateful that they take our views seriously 
and keep us apprised of developments in Springfield. Several legislators 
have been very supportive as well, and we're grateful for their help. We 
also appreciate the efforts of the Alumni Association's Illinois 
Connection, which organized an impressive ""lobby day"" at the state 
Capitol to apprise legislators of the University's needs. They've also 
supported us by encouraging their members to write legislators and 
members of our Congressional delegation to support the University. We're 
fortunate to have such loyal and committed partners. Additionally, our 
Governmental Relations team is also hard at work on these issues with 
legislators in their offices and in the halls of the state Capitol. 
They're working around the clock for us and deserve our thanks for their 
efforts.

Our budget remains a concern. Earlier, I reported on my testimony before 
the appropriations committees, which went well. It's clear from these and 
other conversations that legislators recognize the tremendous value of 
University of Illinois to the state. They're proud of the U of I and 
impressed by our efforts to streamline the University's business 
functions, seek new revenues, improve services, increase efficiencies, 
and generate millions in cost-savings, while protecting our academic 
core. Efforts such as the Administrative Review & Restructuring (ARR) 
programs are helping us achieve this goal, while also making a favorable 
impression on our legislators. With assistance from Springfield and 
careful planning on our part, we've avoided furloughs this year and hope 
to offer a salary program for all eligible faculty and staff in the 
coming fiscal year.

The Board of Trustees has directed us to continue the ARR efforts and 
accelerate them in this continued challenging fiscal environment. The ARR 
Steering Committee - which includes the University Senates Conference 
Chair, the Chancellors, and the CFO - will continue its work to move 
these efforts forward. I appreciate the involvement of many of you in 
this work and the support you're expressing for those leading these 
efforts. 

I know the campuses are engaging in their own reviews and assessments and 
many of you are participating in those efforts. Please know how grateful 
I am for your hard work. The decisions we make about implementing ARR and 
campus initiatives are informed by the insights that you bring to these 
discussions. Yet, it's important to clarify some misconceptions about the 
changes we've made. For instance, one colleague shared concerns with me 
that our consolidation of some of our Human Resources functions removed 
oversight of faculty recruitment, promotion, and tenure from the 
campuses. This is not the case - faculty review procedures remain within 
the purview of the campus. 

Others have expressed alarm upon hearing, incorrectly, that changes in 
administering campus information technology (IT) infrastructure mean that 
IT budgets and operations at all levels of the campuses would be 
eliminated. In fact, the majority of IT delivery occurs at the college 
and department levels and that will continue to be the case. Further, 
campus chief information officers (CIOs) are retaining their portfolios 
and are in regular communication with administrators on the campuses. The 
major change for campus CIOs is that they will play a bigger role in 
University-wide decisions through their reporting line to the 
University's Executive CIO. The administrative changes we're making at 
the infrastructure level will support and improve services, just as they 
will support our academic and research policies rather than determine 
those policies. 

Change can be difficult, but as one of the world's great centers of 
research and innovation, we live with and explore change every day. As 
many of you have shared with me, change is embedded in our research, 
teaching, and service as we seek ongoing improvement in everything we do 
and the world in which we live. I appreciate your forward-looking vision 
and willingness to work on the changes we're currently making and those 
still ahead. These changes will allow us to save millions to protect and 
enhance our core academic priorities during these challenging times and 
to invest in our students, faculty, and staff. I look forward to 
continuing to work with you as we seek improvements and find solutions to 
the challenges we face.

I'm grateful that many of you have accepted invitations to serve on 
advisory groups as we develop governance plans to improve in areas like 
HR and IT. For example, Michael Hites continues to consult with campus 
and collegiate IT leaders and a faculty advisory group recommended by the 
University Senates Conference. He's working closely with them and with 
provosts and chancellors to establish IT governance plans. Likewise, 
Maureen Parks continues to consult with campus HR leaders and Larry 
Schook has formed a faculty advisory committee for the Office of the Vice 
President for Research. We'll continue this pattern of consultation, just 
as we have been doing since the ARR efforts were first undertaken last 
spring. 

We have a very promising future ahead. As I've said before, the 
University of Illinois is a world-class institution, with world-class 
individuals. I believe our best days are ahead. My belief is based on 
what I see in all of you - exceptional, hardworking faculty, staff, and 
students who love the University as much as I do. I wish you all a 
wonderful summer.

Sincerely,

Mike

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Financial Update","April 7, 2011

Dear Colleagues and Friends of the University of Illinois:

I want to take this opportunity to share with you my perspective on the 
state's ongoing budget and pension crises and their possible impact on 
the University in the coming fiscal year -- and beyond. The state's 
budget situation remains grim with a significant operating deficit that 
includes a backlog of unpaid bills expected to approach $7 billion by the 
end of this fiscal year. As of April 4, 2011, the state owes the 
University over $470 million in appropriation and financial aid payments 
for this fiscal year.

The governor proposed a fiscal year 2012 operating budget that would 
maintain funding for public universities at this year's level, with a $25 
million increase proposed in financial aid for eligible students. The 
University's share of this proposal would be a $697 million general 
revenue fund appropriation and approximately $61 million in financial aid 
for our students. However, based on comments at both the Senate and House 
higher education appropriations hearings, we have been forewarned to 
prepare for a significant reduction in our fiscal 2012 appropriation. In 
those hearings I stressed the value of higher education in general, the 
University's key role in generating tangible results for our students and 
the state, and the need for sustained state support to assure our 
continued success. See the URL below for my testimony this week before 
the House Appropriations Committee.
http://www.uillinois.edu/president/speeches/2011/April4.Appropriations.cfm

Two months are remaining in the state's legislative session and we must 
realistically prepare for a reduction in the University's fiscal 2012 
appropriation. The University is no longer protected by Federal stimulus 
stabilization operating grant agreements that prohibited reductions in 
state operating appropriations below certain levels. Legislative 
leadership has indicated that a reduction of the Governor's operating 
budget proposal of as much as $2 billion is under consideration. It is 
too early to predict the outcome of these budget deliberations and the 
ultimate impact on the University, but the campuses and UA have been 
actively planning for various scenarios.  

I am acutely aware that our faculty and staff have not had a general 
compensation increase since August 2008. Avoiding another round of 
furlough days remains one of my top priorities for fiscal 2012, as is a 
meaningful compensation adjustment.

While we will follow closely the fiscal 2012 appropriation budget 
legislation and will push for maximum funding, I am also wary of the 
pension and health-care adjustments that are being discussed in 
Springfield and the profound impact these adjustments would have on our 
faculty and staff.

The State University Retirement System (SURS) funding level has dropped 
to a dangerously low assets-to-long-term-liability ratio of 40% as of 
June 30, 2010, and SURS is paying out substantially more in benefits than 
it takes in contributions. Besides the statutory pension reforms (benefit 
accruals, retirement age) for new employees that became effective January 
1, 2011, there is now some public discussion in the media and by 
legislators of extending these pension reforms to current University 
employees on a prospective basis, as well as possibly increasing employee 
pension contributions or offering alternate defined contribution 
retirement plans. As I said at this week's meeting of the House 
Appropriations Committee, I believe the state should meet its promises to 
our faculty and staff, the majority of whom do not qualify for Social 
Security, to fund pension benefits earned. Lawmakers are also examining 
other benefit changes that would affect University employees and 
retirees, including increasing employee, retiree, and University 
contributions to health insurance; eliminating dependent tuition waivers 
for University employees; taxing benefit payments; and other actions. 
While it is clear there continues to be a state budget crisis in 
Illinois, it is not clear what priorities will be set or actions taken to 
address it.

I am committed to achieving the best outcome possible for our faculty and 
staff, and in the ensuing seven weeks I will work diligently with our 
governmental relations staff and elected officials in Springfield toward 
that goal. Like you, I believe the state should do everything in its 
power to fully fund and honor its commitments. But the state's budget and 
pension funding problems are foreboding, and I want you to be fully 
informed on these issues. 
	
To that end, a pension information forum is being held on each campus 
next week to brief you on current proposed legislation that may affect 
your benefits. On April 11th, 12 noon, the forum will be held at the 
Alice Campbell Alumni Center Ballroom on the Urbana-Champaign campus. 
Another session will be held on April 11th at 4 p.m. in Conference Rooms 
C & D of the Public Affairs Center on our Springfield campus. The session 
on our Chicago campus will be held on April 12th at 2 p.m. at the UIC 
Forum. I urge you to attend one of these sessions to be fully briefed on 
the issues. A website 
https://nessie.uihr.uillinois.edu/cf/policies/index.cfm?Item_ID=4534 is 
available containing the proposed benefit bills, with links to reports 
and summaries which you can use as an additional information resource. We 
are coordinating with other state public universities so that we can 
speak with one voice with a common goal to preserve earned benefits. 

We are living with great uncertainty, but, by working together, we can 
navigate passage through these extremely difficult times and emerge with 
our best days still ahead. As I noted in my testimony before legislative 
committees last month and this month, the University of Illinois is a 
tremendous resource for the state. Our faculty, staff, and students 
continue to generate discoveries that enrich people's lives and add to 
the social, cultural, and economic well-being of the state. I'm deeply 
proud of the work you do and appreciative of your commitment to our great 
University.

Sincerely,
Mike

Michael J. Hogan, President
University of Illinois

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Public Pension System","Dear Campus Community Members,

As you certainly know, the state legislature is considering several 
changes to the public pension system. There have been many news accounts 
about the potential impact to state employees.  We are concerned about 
what is being proposed and have taken steps to closely monitor the 
developments in this area. In accepting a position at a state university, 
we all understood that our pension benefits were part of our compensation, 
and that by serving the state we would not be eligible for Social Security 
benefits.  I am sure you have made your retirement planning decisions 
according to that commitment by the state to provide pension benefits to 
you upon your retirement. 

I write today to assure you that we are working closely with University 
leadership to protect your interests and to make our concerns known to 
members of the state legislature. To learn more about the legislation, 
visit the NESSIE web site at: 
https://nessie.uihr.uillinois.edu/cf/benefits/index.cfm?Item_ID=4534.

series of informational presentations on the pension issues. For more 
information on those events, visit:

We will provide updated information on the Human Resources web site at

You have faithfully contributed your share of funding to the system.  We

 Subject: Announcement of VP/UIS Chancellor","April 4, 2011

Dear Colleagues,

High quality leaders across our three campuses, motivated to nurture 
environments where our talented faculty and students can excel, are 
essential to the continued greatness of the University of Illinois.
 
I am pleased to inform you today that such a leader, Susan J. Koch, 
provost and vice president for academic affairs at Northern Michigan 
University, has been selected to serve as the next Vice President and 
Chancellor of the University of Illinois at Springfield. Dr. Koch will 
join UIS effective July 1, pending Board of Trustees approval.

Susan's quarter-century record at two regional public universities in the 
Midwest reflects a proven appreciation for the value of a strong liberal 
arts education and a deep commitment to civic engagement, both of which 
are hallmarks of the strong reputation our UIS campus has earned in its 
40-year history.

Dr. Koch has served as provost and vice president for academic affairs at 
NMU since 2007. She was the associate provost and dean of the graduate 
college at the University of Northern Iowa. A South Dakota native, Dr. 
Koch earned her bachelor's degree at Dakota State University and her 
master's and doctorate degrees at the University of Northern Iowa, where 
she joined the faculty in 1985. Her field is health education. Additional 
information about Dr. Koch and this announcement can be found at 
http://www.uillinois.edu/UISChancellorSearch/
 
A welcome reception for Dr. Koch will take place from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. 
next Monday, April 11, in the Sangamon Auditorium of the Public Affairs 
Center at UIS.
 
The successful search that led us to Susan Koch is credited to our UIS 
search advisory committee, led by Professor Tih-Fen Ting. The committee 
recruited an outstanding pool of candidates, and I am grateful for their 
work and advice.

Finally, the UIS campus and the entire University of Illinois owe our 
gratitude to Interim Vice President and Chancellor Harry Berman for his 
leadership during this nine-month interim period. Harry has played an 
integral role for 35 years in the transformation and growth of the 
campus. Although he plans to retire soon, we look forward to his 
continued engagement with the UIS community.

Please join me in welcoming Susan Koch to UIS.

Mike Hogan

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Participate in Multimedia Survey","To: Faculty and Staff

The Data Stewardship Initiative and the Center for Multimedia Excellence are working jointly to 
identify multimedia collections to better understand management and preservation requirements 
on campus. The groups will contact faculty and staff to help the campus more clearly understand 
the needs of researchers, multimedia producers and archivists.

We ask that you participate in these efforts by responding to a brief online survey found at 
http://go.illinois.edu/popcensus. This survey seeks to identify collections of audio, film, video, 
and still images of value for research, instructional, and outreach purposes. 

A more detailed census of media collections will follow, conducted through interviews and visits 
to buildings across campus by students from the Graduate School of Library and Information 
Science. In addition, the Data Stewardship Initiative will conduct a second survey focused on non-
media based research data holdings on campus later this spring.

The Data Stewardship Initiative consists of the University Library, Office of the Chief Information 
Officer, Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research, and other campus stakeholders. It was created 
in response to the Stewarding Excellence at Illinois report that recommended that the campus 
develop a baseline understanding of the activities and needs for data services, curation, and 
stewardship. Details are available at http://datasteward.illinois.edu.

The Center for Multimedia Excellence, comprised of campus multimedia professionals, seeks to 
identify individuals and campus units that hold digital and analog media collections in order to 
develop a comprehensive strategy for the preservation of media used for research and non-
research purposes. Details are available at http://go.illinois.edu/mediasurveyinfo.

These efforts are vital to the University's research, education, and public engagement missions. 
Increasingly, funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation are requiring grant 
recipients to better manage and provide access to data generated by projects. 

Even when not required, long-term data storage and accessibility are useful to researchers who 
generate data, as well as to scholars who later use the data in their own work. As a major 
research university, we must identify ways to improve the ability of our researchers to access and 
store data, and we must develop a comprehensive strategy to preserve and share our rich 
multimedia collections here at Illinois.

 Subject: CRIME ALERT","INCIDENT:   Armed Robbery
 
OCCURRED:   March 26 2011, approximately 11:30 am 
 
LOCATION:   1007 W. University Ave., Urbana
 
BRIEF DETAILS:
 
The Urbana Police Department is investigating an armed robbery that 
occurred in the parking lot of Niro's Gyros (1007 W. University Ave., 
Urbana).  The crime was reported to the Urbana Police Department by the 
victim at approximately 12:05 pm.
 
On March 26, at approximately 11:30 am, the victim was leaving Niro's 
Gyros and walking to his car in the parking lot.  As the victim 
approached his car, an individual approached him in the parking lot from 
an alley south of the business and stated, ""Give me what you got or take 
one"".  

The victim replied he didn't understand, and the offender displayed a 
black semi-automatic handgun.  The victim gave the offender some of his 
personal property and the offender left westbound from the parking lot.   
 
OFFENDER DESCRIPTIONS:
 
The offender is described as a black male, approximately 5'06"" tall and 
weighing 160 lbs.  The offender was described as having a goatee, 
wearing a plain black baseball cap, a brown ""pleather"" jacket with 
several zippers on the front, faded blue jeans, and black and grey tennis 
shoes with yellow eyelets.
 
Information about the race or ethnicity of alleged offenders is provided 
only to aid detailed descriptions that include physical stature, clothing 
or unusual characteristics.  Racial descriptions do not by themselves 
offer a meaningful picture of an offenders appearance. 
 
POLICE RESPONSE:
 
The University of Illinois Police Department continues to actively work 
with the Urbana Police Department to identify and apprehend the offender 
in this incident.  Witnesses to this event or those with information are 
encouraged to contact the Urbana Police Department, or the University of 
Illinois Police Department.
 
SAFETY INFORMATION:
 
Members of the campus community are strongly encouraged to follow these 
safety tips to decrease their potential for becoming a victim:
-Stay alert - call the police immediately to report suspicious activity.
-Trust your instincts - if it does not feel right, call for help.
-Avoid walking alone at night.  Travel in groups when possible and always 
walk in well-lit, heavily traveled areas. 
-Turn down your electronic devices. Excessive volume or use of electronic 
devices (iPods, PDAs, cell phones, etc.) can distract you from potential 
safety hazard.
-Drink responsibly - remember your ability to respond is diminished by 
over-consumption of alcohol.

 Subject: UPDATE TO ILLINI-ALERT MESSAGE SENT TODAY","To the campus community:

This morning at 10:40, an Illini-Alert message was sent to 87,000 email 
addresses and cellphones indicating there was an active shooter or threat 
of an active shooter on the Urbana campus. The message was sent 
accidentally while pre-scripted templates used in the Illini-Alert system 
were being updated. The updates were being made in response to user 
feedback in order to enhance information provided in the alerts.

The alert sent today was caused by a person making a mistake. Rather than 
pushing the SAVE button to update the pre-scripted message, the person 
pushed the SUBMIT button. We are working with the provider of the 
Illini-Alert service to implement additional security features in the 
program to prevent this type of error.

The alert system is designed to send all messages as quickly as possible. 
The messages generally leave the sending server within two minutes. This 
design is essential for emergency communications. However, this prevented 
the cancellation of the erroneous alert once it was sent.

Additionally, once we send an emergency message, we are dependent on the 
cellular telephone providers to deliver the text message to the owner of 
the cellphone. This is a recognized issue with all text-messaging 
systems. This is one reason we use multiple communication mechanisms, 
including email and our Emergency Web alert system, which is 
automatically activated when we send an Illini-Alert message. We cannot 
rely solely on text messages to inform our community of an emergency.

The Chief of Police has charged the campus emergency planning office with 
reviewing and documenting todays incident. We are reviewing comments we 
are receiving as a result of the incident and will implement all 
reasonable and appropriate ideas or suggestions.

We recognize the campus community relies on us to provide accurate and 
timely emergency information. We are working diligently to improve our 
processes so that this type of incident does not happen again. Finally, 
we apologize for the confusion and emotional distress caused by the 
initial alert.

 Subject: University Administration staff changes","Dear Colleagues,

Since 2007, Mrinalini (Meena) C. Rao has served the University of 
Illinois with great distinction as Vice President for Academic Affairs, 
the chief academic officer of the University. She has been instrumental 
in fostering cross campus dialog among the three campuses in a number of 
ventures. These range from diversity to setting academic policies for 
research integrity and conflict of commitment and interest. A scholar of 
physiology and biophysics, Dr. Rao maintained an active research program 
in epithelial cell and molecular physiology over the last dozen years 
while serving in senior administrative roles, first on the Chicago campus 
and then in University Administration.

Dr. Rao has decided to focus her efforts fully on research and teaching 
in her role as a Professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics 
and Department of Medicine, and a Fellow of the Honors College at UIC. 
Meena will continue to serve as VP-Academic Affairs until a successor is 
in place, which I expect will be in August. A search committee will be 
formed soon.

The Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs is multi-faceted, 
and Meena's experience, professionalism, and personal dedication have 
helped the office and the University respond to the many challenges we 
have faced in recent years. Reporting to the president and working with 
campus chancellors and provosts, Meena and her staff have helped define 
and shape strategic academic and budgetary priorities and policies for 
the University. They have supported academic initiatives that help to 
differentiate the University of Illinois, including the University of 
Illinois Press, the Institute of Government and Public Affairs (IGPA), 
University-Wide Student Programs, University Outreach and Public 
Services. She has been a key University liaison to the Illinois Board of 
Higher Education, a member of the Diversifying of Faculty of Illinois 
Board, and as VPAA has provided critical support for the work of the 
Board of Trustees Committee on Academic and Student Affairs.
 
In addition to her support of faculty issues and University operations, a 
notable contribution of Meena's tenure as VPAA has been her dedication to 
actualize diversity as a fundamental strength of the University of 
Illinois and initiate a continuing inter-campus dialog with key scholars 
and practitioners. These efforts have led to the establishment of a 
biannual inter-campus diversity summit series, a biannual President's 
Travel Award for Research in Diversity, and an improved contextualization 
of diversity issues for the Board of Trustees through regular 
presentations and briefing documents.
 
Prior to joining the University Administration, Dr. Rao served the UIC 
campus as Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs from 2002 to 2007 and as 
Associate Dean of the Graduate College from 1999 to 2002. A mentor to 
students, faculty, and administrative colleagues, Meena's successful 
collaborations across our three campuses has been a hallmark of her 
administrative service to the University of Illinois, and she has been an 
important and valued colleague to me.

In another administrative change announced previously, after three years 
of distinguished service as Vice President of the Office for Technology 
and Economic Development (now the Office of the Vice President for 
Research), Avijit Ghosh has moved into the role of Special Assistant to 
the President effective March 1.

Reporting directly to the president and working closely with senior 
administrators and other stakeholders, Dr. Ghosh will help to develop and 
implement strategies for reducing costs and improving the effectiveness 
of University-wide administrative services. In particular, Avijit will 
continue to serve as the coordinator of implementation efforts on behalf 
of the Administrative Review and Restructuring (ARR) steering committee, 
a role he has filled since last July. He will work closely with the 
implementation teams appointed by the steering committee, as well as 
campus-based groups, in order to provide a single point of coordination 
for the overall implementation effort. With more than $5 million in 
savings realized through ARR reforms already this year and another $5 
million anticipated by the end of this fiscal year, Avijit has 
demonstrated exceptional leadership in improving and streamlining our 
business processes.
 
This is an important role that President Emeritus Stan Ikenberry 
temporarily performed at my request until he returned to the faculty. As 
a member of the president's cabinet and policy council, Avijit will 
contribute to the discussions of ARR implementation groups and lead other 
projects, especially initiatives facilitating the creation of appropriate 
consultative processes to prioritize projects, budgets and investments 
for administrative functions.

Prior to serving as VP-Technology and Economic Development, Avijit was 
the Dean and a Professor in the College of Business on the Urbana campus 
from 2001 to 2008. I am pleased that Dr. Ghosh will continue to be a part 
of our senior leadership team. He will serve full-time as special 
assistant until next August 15, after which he will divide his time 
equally between this role and as a faculty member in the College of 
Business at Urbana.

Please join me in thanking Meena Rao and Avijit Ghosh for their 
exceptional service to the University administration and in wishing them 
future success.

Sincerely,
Michael J. Hogan

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Legislative Testimony Update","Dear Colleagues,

On Wednesday I had an opportunity to testify before the state Senate 
Appropriations II Committee. It was a great forum for me to articulate 
the ""value proposition,"" as one senator put it, of the state's investment 
in the University of Illinois. I was able to share our many outstanding 
accomplishments, including:

- The University of Illinois produces about $13.1 billion per year in 
direct and indirect economic impact on the Illinois economy -- a return 
of more than $17 for every $1 the state invests through its annual 
appropriation to the University.
- University of Illinois operations directly and indirectly generate more 
than 150,000 jobs in the state annually. 
- The annual activity of our University creates more than $1.3 billion in 
future tax revenue to the state, resulting in a net annual gain to the 
state of about $535 million.  
- The vast health sciences complex on our Chicago campus educates a 
significant number of health care professionals practicing in Illinois 
and provides state-of-the-art care through more than 400,000 patient 
visits each year.
- Our Springfield campus, among the best public liberal arts universities 
in the Midwest, has garnered national recognition for its advances in 
online education and blended learning.
- Graduates of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have the 
highest median mid-career salary among graduates of all Big Ten 
universities, and the ninth-highest median mid-career salary among all 
U.S. public research universities.
- Our Urbana campus students have the second-highest graduation rate in 
the Big Ten and second-lowest debt upon graduation.
- The combined federal research funding across our campuses puts us in 
the top five among U.S. public research universities.
- The wages and salaries of our alumni contribute about $21.2 billion 
annually to the state economy and about 265,000 jobs.

The senators were very impressed by all our contributions to the state. 
The exchange also gave me an opportunity to highlight the distinctive 
missions and exceptional performance of each of our campuses. This 
resonated positively with the senators. At the same time, they 
articulated, as they must, the State's profound long-term budget crisis. 
Their questions covered a wide range of subjects, from faculty and staff 
salaries to tuition waivers to academic programs and administrative 
operations. I aggressively defended our policies, particularly on 
salaries and graduate tuition waivers. I explained that, among other 
things, appropriate compensation adjustments are one of my highest 
priorities. Of course, they wanted to know what we're doing to help 
ourselves, and how we might replace lost positions and increase salaries, 
when there is no additional support for either in the governor's fiscal 
2012 budget proposal. That gave me an opportunity to explain we are 
making progress on the Administrative Review & Restructuring (ARR) 
reforms.

I reported our efforts to streamline business functions across the 
University, with the expectation of building, over three years, annual 
savings of $60 million or more -- funds we must reallocate to manage any 
future cuts in state support, avoid furlough days, make compensation 
adjustments, and replenish some of the faculty and staff positions we 
have lost. I also had an opportunity to explain how the reforms 
implemented thus far have already saved over $5 million in the first half 
of the current fiscal year, and we expect another $5 million by July 1. 

These savings come at a minimum net cost to the University, as we've 
reconfigured four of five positions, rather than creating entirely new 
ones, to implement the reforms. We just announced the appointment of Dr. 
Larry Schook, as interim Vice President for Research. The VP-Research 
role takes on the portfolio of the former Vice President for Technology 
and Economic Development position, along with the added responsibility of 
advancing our research enterprise across the three campuses and in state 
and federal arenas. Also, we've expanded the portfolios of three existing 
and highly experienced administrators:  Steve Veazie, who'll add 
oversight of collective bargaining across our campuses to his 
responsibilities as Deputy University Counsel, is taking on the added 
title of Executive Director of Labor and Employee Relations; Maureen 
Parks, as Executive Director for Human Resources, will add to her 
responsibilities oversight across our campuses of HR services and 
processes involving civil service and academic professionals whose work 
doesn't entail a direct academic role; and Michael Hites, who'll work 
with campus chief information officers (CIOs) as the University's 
Executive CIO to enhance enterprise IT services and infrastructure 
delivered on all our campuses. Finally, we added just one new position, 
an Interim Vice President for Health Affairs, which will be supported by 
clinical revenues. We've appointed Dr. Joe ""Skip"" Garcia to this position 
and charged him with enhancing our clinical healthcare mission, which has 
the potential to realize substantial new revenues and savings, while 
improving education and research opportunities and enhancing service to 
the hundreds of thousands of patients we serve.

I've heard that some might not be aware of these changes or are confused 
about how they're being made. The new cost is nominal, because, as noted 
above, we've reconfigured existing positions, rather than adding new ones 
(except for the VP-Health Affairs). We expect these changes to drive the 
reforms that will produce the $60-plus million in savings that our 
estimates indicate we can achieve. Most important, these changes will 
improve the financial circumstances for each campus, enabling each to 
remain competitive and enhance its performance and its distinctive 
mission. Additionally, our effectiveness in these cost-savings efforts 
will inform the Board's tuition decision, under the policy it adopted at 
the January Board Meeting.

In the midst of the state's profound budget problems and our efforts to 
deal with the implications for our great University, I'm proud that so 
many of you are working collaboratively on these reforms, are focusing on 
the big picture, and are recognizing the opportunity for positive 
transformation, which improves services and saves precious resources. 

As I've been doing, I'll continue to keep you informed of our legislative 
work and our progress on ARR reforms. Since joining our great University 
last July, I've spent hundreds of hours on more than 60 meetings with 
campus senates and their leaders, student groups, deans, department 
chairs, collective bargaining unit leaders, academic professionals, and 
other constituencies comprising our shared governance system. Some may 
wish I could spend more time with them and I'll continue to do my best to 
visit with you. These consultations have been very beneficial and at the 
urging of faculty, staff, and students we've made many changes to 
proposals under consideration before I arrived and shortly thereafter. 
These include: taking the proposal to combine the campus chancellor and 
provost positions off the table; reversing the decision to combine the VP-
Academic Affairs with the VP-TED; keeping the provost title for vice 
chancellors of academic affairs; changing the VP-Research, TED title 
to ""VP-Research;"" and ensuring that the VP-Health Affairs description 
includes alignment of the clinical enterprise with our academic and 
research missions. All these adjustments arose from my consultations with 
so many of you. I'm grateful for your good advice and welcome it as we 
continue to move forward.

None of this would have been possible without your support and the help 
of chancellors, vice presidents, and others on the ARR Steering 
Committee. Also, I'm grateful for the participation of President Emeritus 
Stan Ikenberry, who launched the ARR efforts before I arrived and remains 
a close friend and advisor.

As my session Wednesday with the committee of the state Senate 
demonstrated, we have a great story to tell -- one that impresses our 
senators and the people of our state. I urge you all to keep telling it, 
as I will. Our story is one of sustained success and accomplishment, even 
in very challenging times. Leaders throughout the state and nation are 
looking to the University of Illinois to bring the exceptional talents of 
our faculty, staff, and students to bear on the pressing issues of our 
time. I couldn't be more proud of how we are rising to these challenges 
and of the tremendous progress we are making together.

Sincerely,

Mike

 Subject: University update","Dear Colleagues, 
Thank you for your continued hard work and support as we navigate a 
variety of challenging issues. It's a busy time in Springfield and at 
University and I'm hearing from many of you about these challenges. I look 
forward to continuing to visit with you, but in the meantime, let me 
address questions I've been hearing:
  Q:  What can you tell us about pension reform?
  A:  Pension reform is troubling because it could negatively affect our 
current employees and compromise recruitment efforts. We hope the State 
will meet commitments it's made to our employees and our Governmental 
Relations staff is working hard on this issue in Springfield. Yet, we must 
remember that pension issues are one part of larger budget issues in the 
state. We must try to advance our interests in this area, without damaging 
our interests in other areas important to the University.
  Q:  What is the State budget situation?
  A:  The passage of new tax legislation promises to reduce the state's 
structural deficit and offers a partial solution to our serious budget 
problems. Still, the State faces billions in unpaid bills. Eliminating 
this deficit may take a combination of borrowing, new revenues, and 
reduced expenditures, which may include reductions in support for the 
University. Currently, the State owes the University almost $500 million 
of its FY 2011 operating budget and MAP (student financial aid) funding, 
even though we're nearly eight months into the current fiscal year. 
Dealing with this may require the State to borrow some additional money as 
part of a debt restructuring plan, which may or may not win legislative 
support before the end of the fiscal year. It is clear that the State has 
long-term structural fiscal problems to deal with, as well as the short-
term cash crisis, and we are not out of the woods yet. We must continue to 
monitor resources diligently and manage State allocations as carefully as 
possible.
  Q:  Why are we trimming our budgets further, when the Governor's budget 
doesn't decrease our appropriation?
  A:  We're grateful to the Governor for not proposing further cuts to our 
budget in his recent address. Still, we know that flat funding doesn't 
account for cost increases or inflation in our costs, and it doesn't 
support compensation adjustments or replacement of lost faculty and staff. 
We must pay our bills, including paying faculty and staff, even if the 
State doesn't enact a debt restructuring plan and State payments to us 
continue to lag. Also, I promised that I would not support furloughs. I'm 
glad that I've kept that promise and careful budget oversight will help us 
avoid furloughs next year, as well. Depending on State action, I'm hopeful 
that we'll be able to provide our faculty and staff with the first 
compensation adjustment we've had since August 2008. This remains one of 
my highest priorities.  In short, our budget constraints safeguard us 
against further delays in State payments or rescissions this year and 
next; buffer us against potential reductions in our State appropriation or 
other adjustments to our budget; help us avoid furlough days; and, I hope, 
cover costs of a compensation program.
  Q:  What about other revenues to replace state funding?
  A:  First, our hardworking faculty and staff continue to do more with 
less and generate new revenues. Our Interim VP for Research, Larry Schook, 
will work with colleagues to drive our research numbers higher. We're also 
appointing a director of federal relations in Washington, D.C, who will 
further expand our federal funding opportunities. Also, Dr. Schook will 
work in Washington, Springfield, and through our corporate partnerships to 
open new avenues for revenue opportunities.  And, we're coming to the end 
of a very successful capital campaign and expect to meet, even exceed, our 
$2.25 billion Brilliant Futures goal. This will dovetail with a new 
initiative to raise millions for new scholarships, particularly need-based 
scholarships. At the same time, we're exploring new and more successful 
ways to organize our fundraising operations. The goal of this effort will 
be to obtain a much better return on our investment. Finally, tuition is 
now our largest and most reliable revenue source. To our Board's credit, 
trustees want to make it more predictable for our students and their 
families, by tying tuition increases to inflation rates, State 
appropriations, and the success of our efforts to reduce administrative 
costs. Achieving a proper balance between these revenue sources and 
administrative efficiencies is the key to our long-term well-being. 
  Q:  Where are we with the Administrative Review & Restructuring (ARR) 
report and the efficiencies it recommends?
  A:  Under the leadership of Stan Ikenberry and Avijit Ghosh, we're 
making great progress. We're actively implementing the ARR reforms in many 
areas, including procurement, capital projects, human resources, and 
information technology. More work will be ongoing. We've already realized 
about $5 million in recurring annual administrative costs and expect that 
number to about double by the end of this fiscal year. These reforms are 
overseen by a steering committee, which includes the chancellors, vice 
presidents and the chair of our University Senates Conference. In each 
area, we also benefit from the advice of implementation committees that 
include campus-level experts. Let me take this opportunity to express my 
sincere appreciation for the help and good work of all of the people 
involved, even though at times it entails changes that can be difficult to 
make.
  Q: How are we covering costs of new administrative positions and how 
does this square with reducing administrative overhead?
  A:  The new cost for these positions is nominal. The VP for Health 
Affairs is covered by clinical revenues, not new general fund costs. The 
cost for the VP-Research is not new. This is a re-titling of the existing 
VP for Technology and Economic Development. Our new Executive Director of 
Human Resources and Executive Chief Information Officer are not new hires. 
They're internal promotions. We expect all these positions to either 
generate new revenues or further cost-reductions. What's involved is not 
additional cost, but rather reallocation of resources to generate more 
revenue, reduce costs, and improve the services we provide for our 
faculty, staff, and students. This is what our University has always done, 
particularly when facing financial stress, to remain great and improve its 
competitive position.
  Q:  What is the status of the searches for a new Vice President & 
Chancellor on our Springfield and Urbana-Champaign campuses?
  A:  Thanks to the outstanding work of the search advisory committees, 
these searches are going very well. Let me express my gratitude to both 
committees, chaired by Dr. Tih-Fen Ting (Springfield) and Dr. Doug Beck 
(Urbana-Champaign). The search for at Springfield is in its final stages, 
as the committee has put forth its finalists. The search advisory 
committee for the VP/Chancellor at UIUC, formed in December, already 
posted the position description and is receiving nominations. I want to 
personally extend my gratitude to the committee members, who are 
dedicating so much time and effort to these important searches. 
  Q:  What are we doing about the new procurement reform law?
  A: Nothing has been more aggravating to all of us who must deal with the 
onerous regulatory processes embedded in this policy. I know that all of 
us, as public employees, expect to comply with reasonable systems of 
accountability. But, we believe there should be a proper balance between 
accountability and regulation that undermines our effectiveness. I want to 
thank our University Ethics Officer, Donna McNeely, and our Office of 
Business and Financial Services for their ongoing efforts to secure 
reasonable adjustments to how this new procurement law is interpreted and 
applied. I also want to thank the various state agencies, which have made 
these adjustments. At the same time, our Office of Governmental Relations 
is working tirelessly to call the attention of these same officials, as 
well as legislators in Springfield, to the need for further adjustments to 
the policy. 

I hope these answers to the questions and concerns I'm hearing is 
informative. Rest assured that others will follow as I try to keep you 
abreast of the progress we are making on these and the other issues with 
which we're dealing. Thank you for your time and consideration. Mostly, 
thank you for all you do each day to help us through these challenging 
times.

Sincerely,
Mike

On Friday, March 4, 2011, many students and visitors will participate in 
an event known as Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. While the University does 
not support or condone this event, steps are being taken to ensure safety 
and to minimize disruption to classes and campus operations.

The Champaign, Urbana, and University of Illinois police departments, 
assisted by other local and state agencies, will patrol the campus 
district on March 4. They will enforce all applicable ordinances in 
commercial and residential areas, and have authority to intervene if 
private parties threaten to disturb the peace. In addition, Champaign and 
Urbana officials will enact restrictions on liquor sales intended to curb 
overconsumption. Emergency medical personnel will be available to provide 
care.

University police will continue to focus on protecting students, staff, 
faculty, and University property. In case of emergency, call METCAD at 
911 (from campus phones, call 9-911). For non-emergencies, call 333-1216.

As in years past, we have made clear to students that academic business 
will continue as usual on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. That has helped 
to minimize disruptions. Instructors should not need to alter 
instructional plans.

The Student Code (http://www.admin.uiuc.edu/policy/code/) addresses 
student responsibilities on campus. Sections 1-102(d) and 1-302(f) 
concern classroom conduct expectations, and section 1-307 focuses on 
alcohol consumption. The Code empowers instructors to ask disruptive 
students to leave class; after class, names of disruptive students should 
be reported to the Office for Student Conflict Resolution at 333-3680 or 
online at 
http://www.conflictresolution.uiuc.edu/forms/incidentReport/form.asp.

If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into a 
confrontation, you may seek assistance. From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on March 
4, teams of Student Affairs and Academic Affairs professionals will walk 
through and around buildings with classrooms and lecture halls where 
disruptions were experienced in the past. Team members, wearing 
University IDs, may be summoned to help. Teams will be prepared to 
document apparent Code violations and to call University police, if 
necessary.

Students will be asked not to bring any liquids into Foellinger 
Auditorium. (Longstanding policy prohibits liquids and food in 
Foellinger.)

Students who interfere with the academic mission of the University will 
face serious consequences. Thank you for reinforcing this message before 
and on March 4.

From:	Robert A. Easter
	Vice President and Chancellor (Interim)

Re:	Snow Day Pay - February 2, 2011

In response to several questions from campus units, I am writing to 
clarify how employees should be paid for Wednesday, February 2, 2011. 

As previously stated in the email that was sent to all employees and 
students on Tuesday, February 1, at 9:47 pm, the campus remained open on 
February 2, 2011.  Classes were cancelled for that day, and two units 
were announced as closed:  the Library and all CITES computer labs.  
Employees were instructed to consult the campus policy on operations 
under emergency conditions and to consult with their departmental 
supervisor.

Clarification for payment is as follows:  

- Essential employees who worked their regular shift should be paid for 
hours worked, including overtime, if appropriate and in accordance with 
standard policies.

- Employees who were told their unit would be officially closed on 
February 2, 2011, should be paid for their entire regular shift.  
Official notification could have come from posting on the campus website 
or an email from a dean, director or department head.
  
- Employees who reported to work on February 2, 2011, should be paid 
their regular rate of pay for the hours worked on that date.

- Employees in offices that did not close and who did not report to work 
on February 2, 2011, should charge vacation or other personal leave 
(e.g., floating holiday, compensatory time).  If an employee does not 
have sufficient benefit balances to cover the time off, the time not 
covered by a benefit will be excused without pay (benefits must be used 
first).  

- Employees who were scheduled to work on February 2, 2011, and who 
called in prior to the Chancellor's Feb. 1 announcements indicating they 
were unable to come to work due to inclement weather should use vacation 
or other personal leave.

- Employees who were scheduled to work and called in sick should use sick 
leave.

Pursuant to my announcement on February 1, 2011, and policy, essential 
employees are defined as those employees providing emergency or direct 
student services.  Units were responsible for determining which employees 
were designated essential for this event.  A decision regarding 
additional consideration for those employees designated as essential who 
worked on Feb. 2, 2011, is pending.

 Subject: Interim Vice Presidents Named","February 2, 2011

Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,

Our Board of Trustees in November adopted a critical realignment of the 
University's administrative structure, one intended to make our 
organization more cohesive, to strengthen our hand in grappling with 
chronically difficult financial conditions and, ultimately, to sustain 
the University of Illinois' greatness for future generations. The 
restructuring followed months of collective self-examination, 
deliberation and consultation among faculty, students, staff, our 
trustees and me. I deeply appreciate the work of everyone involved.

I am pleased today to announce the appointments of two outstanding 
individuals - each one an exemplar of the excellence of the University 
of Illinois - to key roles as part of the restructuring process. They are:

- As interim Vice President for Research, Professor Lawrence B. Schook, 
Director of the Division of Biomedical Sciences at the Urbana-Champaign 
campus.

Larry is an internationally renowned scholar in genomics with significant 
leadership experience in building strategic alliances and in winning tens 
of millions of dollars in competitively awarded research grants.  

- As interim Vice President for Health Affairs, Joe G.N. ""Skip"" Garcia, 
M.D., Vice Chancellor for Research and a professor in the College of 
Medicine at the Chicago campus. 

A physician-scientist with an esteemed international reputation for his 
expertise in lung disease and its prevention, Skip came to UIC a year ago 
with a broad range of clinical and research leadership experience. Skip 
also has a strong track record for attracting research funding.

Biographies of Larry Schook and Skip Garcia, as well as background 
information on the administrative realignment, may be found at 
http://www.uillinois.edu/our/news/2011/Feb2.VP.links.cfm.

We can be proud that the University of Illinois has within its faculty 
and administration scholars as capable as Larry Schook and Skip Garcia to 
step into these roles at such a crucial time for the University. Skip 
will move into his interim position Feb. 16, and Larry will move into his 
on March 1, subject to Board of Trustees formal approval in March. The 
University will conduct searches within the next year to fill both 
positions permanently.

As you may recall when our trustees approved these positions, the goal 
was, first and foremost, to improve our research and clinical health care 
missions, in part by establishing better cooperation and coordination 
across the three campuses. The changes followed recommendations made in 
last year's Administrative Review and Restructuring (ARR) report.

The office of the vice president for research was established by re-
titling the vice president for technology and economic development and 
expanding into that portfolio important responsibilities for the 
University's vast $725 million-a-year, externally funded research 
enterprise. The VP-Research will facilitate collaborative research 
opportunities, streamline related policies and procedures, and act as a 
coherent, unified voice for U of I research.
 
Larry is the Gutgsell Professor in the Department of Animal Sciences on 
the Urbana campus. As the Director of the Division of Biomedical 
Sciences, he is responsible for directing strategic alliances related to 
health research and leading the Illinois Health Sciences Initiative that 
coordinates Urbana campus research and educational programs. He holds 
joint appointments in bioengineering, nutritional sciences, and in 
pathology, part of the UIC College of Medicine, and has faculty 
appointments with the Institute for Genomic Biology and the Beckman 
Institute for Advanced Science and Technology. His scholarly activities 
include authoring more than 200 publications and editing six books. He is 
the founding editor of Animal Biotechnology.

After three years of excellent service as vice president for technology 
and economic development, Avijit Ghosh will move into the role of special 
assistant to the president, an important function interim President Stan 
Ikenberry temporarily performed until his recent return to the faculty. 
Avijit will assist in the vice president's office transition to VP-
Research and in the implementation of the cost-saving measures 
recommended by the ARR working group.

The office of the vice president for health affairs was created in 
recognition of the fact that while most of the clinical health care 
enterprise, which accounts for about one-third of the University's 
operating budget, is housed at UIC, it extends throughout the university 
and most of Illinois. The VP-Health Affairs reports directly to the 
president with a secondary reporting relationship to the UIC vice 
president/chancellor. Responsibilities include oversight of the 
University's hospital, long overdue for renovation; connecting better the 
clinical mission to the research and teaching missions; and generating 
additional clinical revenue. 

Skip joined UIC last February after four years as chair of the department 
of Medicine at the University of Chicago. At UIC, he is the Earl M. Bane 
Professor of Medicine, Pharmacology and Bioengineering. The author or co-
author of nearly 350 peer-reviewed publications and 25 book chapters, 
Skip is internationally recognized for his expertise on the genetic basis 
of lung disease and the prevention and treatment of inflammatory lung 
injury, especially in susceptible populations such as African Americans 
and Latinos. Several of his approaches to prevent vascular leak have been 
patented. He is a passionate advocate for the training of physician 
scientists and is an active supporter of minority medical and science 
students. Skip will continue to serve as UIC's Vice Chancellor for 
Research.

Please join me in welcoming Larry and Skip, and thanking them for their 
willingness to take on these important new responsibilities.
 
Sincerely,

Michael J. Hogan
President

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Increase Income Tax Withholding for Emloyees","
On January 12, 2011, the Illinois legislature approved an increase in the 
state individual income tax rate from 3% to 5%, which Governor Quinn 
signed on January 13, 2011.  As a result of this increase, the University 
must change the withholding rate on employee wages from 3% to 5%. 

The new withholding rate will be implemented with payrolls paid on or 
after January 26, 2011.  Since the rates are effective January 1, 2011 
and due to the late passage of the increased rate, you may owe additional 
income tax next year when you file your 2011 Illinois individual income 
tax return.  

To see how this change affects your state income tax withholding and your 
net pay, you can use the Payroll and Earnings net pay calculators located 
at: 

Monthly Net Pay calculator 


Bi-Weekly Net Pay calculator

candidates. To help us, we have engaged Isaacson, Miller, a highly 
respected executive search firm specializing in mission-driven 
organizations [http://www.imsearch.com]. Michael Baer and Pamela Pezzoli 
of I,M will visit the campus next week. In order to help us to both 
identify the most suitable potential candidates, and develop the most 
appropriate candidate background material for the search committee's 
consideration, we would like to provide you an opportunity to meet with 
Michael, Pam and myself:

We also strongly encourage you to visit the search website where you will 
find links to nominate candidates, or to comment on the qualities the 
VP/C should have, at http://www.uillinois.edu/UrbanaChancellorSearch/ 

Broadly, we are looking first for someone with an outstanding record of 
scholarly achievement and leadership, and for someone who also has a keen 
sense of the difficult issues currently confronting public higher 
education. The focus of our discussions will be the important particular 
qualities of, and the challenges facing, the new VP/C. After a brief 
introduction to the responsibilities of the VP/C and to the search 
process, we will invite your input. The categories of topics we are 
interested in are:

1) Objectives for the new VP/C. What do you want the new VP/C to 
accomplish? What are the desired outcomes for the role and for the 
University? How will you know in three to five years that the right 
person was hired? What will have happened?

2) Qualifications and Experience. Based on the objectives identified, 
what do you think are the qualifications and experience of an ideal 
candidate? What is essential and what might be helpful?

3) Personal Qualities. What are the personal attributes most important 
for this role?

Thank you for your participation in this important effort; we look 
forward to working with you.

I am pleased to announce the formation this week of a campus committee to 
lead the search for a new permanent vice president and chancellor for the 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, with the intention of having 
the new chancellor on board for the start of the next academic year.

I commend the campus Senate for assembling the search committee at this 
busy time of the year and thank physics Professor Douglas Beck for 
accepting my request that he serve as committee chair. Dr. Beck is an 
outstanding member of the faculty respected by his colleagues and 
students, and I am confident Doug will serve the chancellor search with 
equal verve.

Assisting the committee will be Jami Painter, Director of Employee 
Relations and Human Resources, and the executive search firm of Isaacson, 
Miller. The firm is experienced in executive searches for major 
universities and colleges, including the University of Illinois, an 
important asset in this search.

A website for the Urbana-Champaign campus vice president/chancellor search 
has been established and can be found at 
http://uillinois.edu/UrbanaChancellorSearch/. (The site will be live early 
on Dec. 17 but does not yet contain complete information.) In addition to 
links to core information about the campus and search information, the 
website will include a link to a Facebook page and a web form to accept 
input from our varied constituencies. 

Because receiving input from you is essential, the committee also will 
host town hall-style meetings at which our faculty, students, staff and 
others may voice their suggestions and opinions. 
  
As I am doing with the search for the vice president and chancellor of the 
UIS campus, I will meet regularly with the search committee, beginning as 
soon as next week, and will keep the University's Board of Trustees 
informed. I will interview the finalists, and I will make a recommendation 
to the trustees next spring. Again, my goal, shared by the Board and the 
members of the search committee, is to have an exceptional, experienced 
leader in higher education as the next vice president and chancellor of 
the Urbana campus in time for the fall 2011 semester.

The selection of the new chancellor for Urbana is potentially the most 
important undertaking for this campus that members of the search committee 
and I will have during our association with the University of Illinois. We 
look forward to the challenge and to working with all of you.

Sincerely,

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Review of Doctoral Programs on Campus","I write to inform you that I have charged an 18 member committee, chaired 
by Deba Dutta, Dean of the Graduate College, to conduct a review of all 
doctoral programs on campus.  The charge letter to the committee, 
available through this link, identifies committee members and outlines 
the process the review will follow: 
http://provost.illinois.edu/committees/reports/Charge%20letters%2010-
11/Assessing_Doctoral_Programs_Charge10-11.pdf. 

Doctoral education is an enormously important part of what we do at 
Illinois, and we have not looked comprehensively at our strengths and 
needs in this area for a very long time. This assessment of doctoral 
programs will address fundamental questions about the overall scope of 
doctoral education at Illinois. In addition to the size, quality, demand 
and effectiveness of individual doctoral programs, this assessment will 
take into account measures of success for each program (e.g., time to 
degree, completion rates, job placements, etc.). 

Your help with program information, as requested by the committee, will 
be most appreciated.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Campus Safety","The campus district has experienced a rise in crime against individuals 
this semester. From September 1, 2010, to November 30, 2010, aggravated 
assaults and batteries are up to 14 from 12 during the same time period 
in 2009. During that same time period, criminal sexual assaults have 
increased to 8 in 2010 from 6 in 2009, and robberies increased to 20 in 
2010 from 6 in 2009. Widespread awareness of this situation has 
intensified somewhat by more aggressive practices for reporting crimes in 
the campus area and has distressed students and their families, those of 
us who work on campus, and the larger University of Illinois community.  

Several measures have been put in place to address those areas of the 
campus district most directly affected by increases in crime. For some 
examples, the Chancellor has authorized Chief Barbara OConnor to add 
three officers, and three additional appointments are planned. The campus 
police force, working hundreds of hours of overtime, has stepped up 
patrols in areas where crimes have occurred. Campus police officials are 
working especially closely with the Champaign police, but also the Urbana 
police, the Champaign County Sherriff, and the State Police. Much of the 
campus is now reached through surveillance cameras and more are being 
installed. Several arrests have been made. A security firm has been hired 
to monitor activities in residence halls, and hundreds of new locks have 
been installed in residence hall bathrooms. Student patrols have been 
increased. The SafeWalks program has been augmented, and is available 
earlier in the evening, and the SafeRides program is also a good resource 
for students. 

A group of student leaders has been meeting to develop a safety awareness 
campaign they are calling I-Watch: A Community that Cares. Because you, 
as faculty, have extensive contacts with students, the student group 
would like to invite you to join in creating a safer campus community. 

Here are some of the students suggestions:

-Talk to your students about safety. Remind them at the end of class to 
be cautious, call SafeRides or SafeWalks, or walk in groups, especially 
if its after dark 
-Include information about safety resources, which will include emergency 
phone numbers, in your syllabi
-Have the last slide of your power point lecture illustrate safety bullet 
points and have it on screen as students leave the room
-Distribute safety cards and warning whistles as appropriate
-If you have night classes, tests or finals scheduled, you may call UIPD 
at 333-1216 and let them know the time and location of the session so 
that they can be aware of the situation. Tell your students to consider 
calling SafeWalks for a walk home after the class or test. 

If you chose to participate in this safety initiative, you are invited to 
go to www.studentaffairs.illinois.edu/iwatchfaculty.html for information 
for course syllabi, the power point slide, information to obtain cards 
and whistles and other resources. The UIPD website is also an excellent 
resource www.dps.illinois.edu.

Thank you for helping make the University of Illinois a safer campus. 
Working together, we can help make the end of classes and finals week as 
safe as possible for our students, and bring a new level of safety to the 
new year.

 Subject: CRIME-ALERT","INCIDENT:   Aggravated Battery & Robbery
 
OCCURRED:   November 14th, 2010, 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. 

LOCATION:   400 East Healey Street, Champaign

BRIEF DETAILS:

The Champaign Police Department is investigating an aggravated battery 
and robbery that occurred near the 400 block of East Healey Street, 
Champaign.  The crimes were reported by the victim on November 15th at 
approximately 12:30 pm.  

On November 14th, 2010 sometime between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm, the victim 
was walking from the Colonial Pantry located at 312 E. Green Street 
towards the 400 block of East Healey Street when two other individuals 
approached him.  When the two individuals got close enough to the victim, 
they punched him and knocked him to the ground.  The offenders grabbed 
the victim's property and ran away from the scene.  The victim sustained 
minor injuries during the incident.

OFFENDER DESCRIPTIONS:

The first offender is described as a white male in his 20's, 
approximately 6 feet tall, weighing approximately 160 pounds, straight 
brown hair, wearing a black beanie hat with no bill and an oversized dark 
solid-colored sweatshirt or similar clothing which was too large for 
him.  The victim could not provide a description of the second suspect.

POLICE RESPONSE:

The Champaign Police Department continues to actively work to identify 
and apprehend the offenders in this incident.  Witnesses to this event or 
those with information are encouraged to contact the Champaign Police 
Department.

SAFETY INFORMATION:

Members of the campus community are strongly encouraged to follow these 
safety tips to decrease their potential for becoming a victim:
- Stay alert - call the police immediately to report suspicious activity.
- Trust your instincts - if it does not feel right, call for help.
- Avoid walking alone at night.  Travel in groups when possible and 
always walk in well-lit, heavily traveled areas. 
- Turn down your electronic devices. Excessive volume or use of 
electronic devices (iPods, PDAs, cell phones, etc.) can distract you from 
a potential safety hazard.
- Drink responsibly - remember your ability to respond is diminished by 
over-consumption of alcohol.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

Anyone with information about this incident should call the Champaign 
Police Department at 217-351-4545.  

Information also can be shared anonymously through Crimestoppers by 
calling 217-373-TIPS or online at:

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Town Hall Regarding Campus Safety","Dear Students: 

We write to remind you about tomorrow afternoon's Town Hall regarding
safety on campus. We hope you can attend, and we hope you will bring your
parents or, if they aren't visiting campus this weekend, encourage them to
watch the live stream at http://illinois.edu/here_now/videos.html. 

As we prepare for the meeting, I ask all of you to be mindful that we are a
campus community that prides itself on a talented and diverse population.
Notwithstanding the exemplary contributions of all the members of our
campus and community, we are, regrettably, part of a nation in which racial
stereotyping and profiling remain persistent challenges.  These challenges
are heightened in times of stress and tension, such as has occurred in the
recent series of assaults in the campus town area.  Especially during these
times, however, we must respect and appreciate the presence of everyone
attending or visiting the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Although our crime alerts sometimes include information about the race or
ethnicity of alleged perpetrators, our goal should be to use this only to
aid detailed descriptions that include physical stature, clothing, unusual
characteristics, and perhaps the description of a vehicle. Racial
descriptions of criminal suspects do not by themselves offer a meaningful
picture of an assailant's appearance, and they should not be used
indiscriminately to describe large segments of our community.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Campus Safety Update","TO: Students, Faculty Staff, Alumni and Other Members of our Campus 
Community

Over the past three months there has been an increase in batteries, 
robberies and similar crimes on the Champaign-Urbana campus. The campus 
has responded quickly with a focused determination and we will continue 
to take any and all necessary steps to end this trend.
  
We are mindful that there is much anxiety in our community. That is why 
we are holding a Town Hall Meeting on Campus Safety at 3 p.m., Saturday, 
November 13, at Illini Union's Courtyard Cafe. The Chief of Police, the 
Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, the Director of Housing and the Dean 
of Students will be on hand to answer questions and provide information 
about campus safety programs. The event will be streamed live at 
http://illinois.edu/here_now/videos.html as well as for viewing at a 
later time. Questions may be phoned in during the meeting at 217-244-8938.

Several key measures we have taken to date:

- Authorized the hiring of three additional police officers and 
unlimited overtime for the police department.

- Installed dozens of cameras in high-crime areas and more than 200 in 
total across campus.

- Worked with the Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District (MTD) to use 
their cameras and locations to install more cameras.
 
- Increased student patrols, and aggressively promoted our SafeWalks and 
SafeRides programs.

- Increased security in residence halls. University Housing has locked 
all outside security doors in all halls.

- Facilitated a meeting of city administrators from Champaign and 
Urbana, including police chiefs and the Champaign County Sheriff, to 
create a process for increased coordination and cooperation among the 
four departments. All departments and the Sheriff's Office are 
expending large amounts of overtime to solve this issue, saturating the 
Campus District for the last three weekends with increased patrols. In 
recent weeks police have made more than 25 apprehensions surrounding 
campus assaults and robberies.

For an important FAQ with University of Illinois Police Chief Barb 
O'Connor go to: http://dps.illinois.edu/faq.html
  
We will not tolerate attacks on our students, employees or visitors to 
our campus. We realize that our university is a public institution and 
our objective is not to become a police state. However, extraordinary 
circumstances require extraordinary responses. Moving forward, we will 
act in the best interest of our campus community and we will continue to 
do whatever it takes to meet and exceed everyone's expectation of safety.

Innovation Summit
Building Bridges to Interdisciplinary Learning at Illinois
Integrating Education and Research
Beckman Institute Auditorium
April 13 & 14, 2011

http://summit.research.illinois.edu

The world is ever changing and with it higher education. With rapid 
globalization, employers of all sizes have developed the flexibility to 
move swiftly, transforming their labor force and ways of working operating 
wherever they can find a ready and available talent pool. The grand 
challenges facing contemporary society require solutions spearheaded by 
teams of interdisciplinary scholars. Likewise, the world's students, at 
all levels, migrate in an increasingly deregulated global education 
sector.  The great university cannot rest easy; it must evolve and renew 
itself for the next generation, preparing education that can meet the 
needs of this transforming world.  At the University of Illinois, we 
aspire to take full advantage of this opportunity to confront these 
challenges head on at this critical historic juncture. This calls for a 
move toward an interdisciplinary education in step with interdisciplinary 
research.

This summit aims to galvanize a campus dialogue on interdisciplinary 
research and education for students, staff, and faculty that will support 
and sustain Illinois as a leader in interdisciplinary learning.  

Fundamental questions

-What are the potentials for and challenges facing interdisciplinary 
research and education?

-How can we engage interdisciplinary education to support 
interdisciplinary research?

-What resources and programs at the University of Illinois can enhance 
interdisciplinary experiences?  

-What changes should be instituted on campus to make broad-based 
interdisciplinary education and research a reality?  

Outcomes

The summit is expected to result in a challenge to the University to 
transform the educational system to better meet the needs of the next 
generation of students. We call for concrete proposals to make Illinois a 
leader in interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary education and research. 
We envision a blueprint that considers what it will take to afford 
Illinois students, staff, and faculty interdisciplinary research and 
education opportunities in synch with our changing world.

Call for workshop proposals

We invite faculty to host topical or problem-driven pre-summit workshops 
whose outcomes can then animate the summit.  The aim of these workshops is 
to examine the interaction and integration between interdisciplinary 
education and research in a number of different areas.    

Workshops should involve multiple disciplines and extend beyond the 
departmental boundaries.  Workshop themes could encompass, but are not 
limited to, the following broad domains:

Themes Anchored in Core Human Needs:
-Health: New Frontiers of Wellness, Prevention, and Medicine 
-Hunger: Comprehensive Plans to Feed a Hungry World 
-Water:  Interdisciplinary Perspectives on the Delivery and Use of Water 
Resources
-Shelter:  Sustainable Models for Financing and Meeting the Complex Needs 
for Housing in Developed and Developing Economies
-Business:  Integrative Perspectives on the Rise and Fall of Business 
Markets
-Work:  Knowledge-Driven Work at Individual, Group, Organizational, 
Institutional and System Levels
-Community:  Creating Safe Communities for Education, Families, and 
Economic Growth
-Law:  Corporate Social Responsibility and Government Regulation in an Era 
of Accelerating Change
-Energy:  Social and Technical Dimensions of Distributed Power Generation 
and Distribution
-Environment:  Interdisciplinary Climate Research
-Food: Access to, Distribution Practices, and Promotion of Healthy Food 
For the Health and Economic Development of Communities

Themes Centered on The Future of Higher Education:
-The Role of the Humanities in Interdisciplinary Research
-Connects and Disconnects Between Interdisciplinary Research and 
Interdisciplinary Education
-Transdisciplinary Approaches to Training Grants 
-Social Science and Interdisciplinary Research 
-NSF Science and Technology Centers ? a Paradigm for Interdisciplinary 
Research
-Breadth at the Expense of Depth in Interdisciplinary Education and 
Research

The daylong pre-summit workshops should take place in February and March 
and include the participation of graduate and undergraduate students as 
appropriate.  The knowledge and conversations from these workshops will be 
presented at the April 2011 Summit by the respective faculty member(s) 
hosting the workshop. It is expected that at least one representative from 
each workshop be present on the second day of the summit to participate in 
the development of recommendations.

If you are interested in hosting a pre-Summit Workshop, online 
applications are available at 
http://summit.research.illinois.edu/WorkshopSubmission.aspx) and are due 
by December 10, 2010.  Decisions will be announced in early January.

The host UI faculty will be responsible for securing a venue for their 
workshop, optional external speaker(s), and arranging food and 
refreshments for the workshop participants.  In addition, hosts are 
required to provide a short summary after the workshop indicating who 
attended major issues addressed, and provisional 
conclusions/recommendations.  

If funds are requested, please fill out a budget summary on the enclosed 
form (or on the web site).  You may request funds for a nominal honorarium 
($500 maximum suggested per external speaker), up to two days per diem,

Re: Student Nominations for Chancellor Search Committee

Greetings, fellow Illini!

As you may be aware, the campus is preparing to search for a Chancellor. 
As a result, the Academic Senate Committee on Committees, in consultation 
with the Illinois Student Senate Committee on Appointments, has been asked 
to develop a slate of nominees for search committee membership. In 
accordance with procedures approved by the Academic Senate on November 8, 
2010, the Search Committee will consist of one faculty chair, eight 
additional faculty, three students, one dean or director, one academic 
professional, and one staff member.

The Academic Senate will vote on search committee membership from all of 
the above constituencies (including two finalists for chair) in a two-
stage online election to be held shortly after Thanksgiving break. The 
first stage will consist of selecting a chair. The second stage will be 
devoted to selecting search committee members. In order to facilitate that 
process, the Senate Executive Committee has asked the Committee on 
Committees to identify 3 to 6 students who are willing to serve.

Therefore, we ask that all interested students fill out an application in 
order to be considered for nomination.  The application can be found at
https://illinois.edu/fb/sec/7234824 
Please complete all applications by 12:00 noon on Wednesday, November 17.

began to argue with the girlfriend of the victim.  As the victim 
attempted to stop the verbal altercation, he was punched in the mouth 
several times by the offender.  The offender then joined a group of five

Armory.  The victim sought medical care for injuries resulting from this 
battery requiring surgery.

The offender is described as a white male, approximately 6 feet to 6 feet 
2 inches tall, weighing between 170 and 200 pounds with short brown

girlfriend of the victim advised the offender may have been dressed as a 
basketball player for Halloween.  The victim and the girlfriend were not 
able to provide specific descriptions of the other individuals the

 Subject: Amendments Proposed by Board of Trustees","Dear Members of the University Community,

At our September 23rd Board of Trustees meeting, the Trustees called on me 
to move forward with a plan to re-structure the administration of the 
University of Illinois in order to reduce costs, streamline operations, 
create opportunities to generate new revenues, and better coordinate our 
shared teaching and research missions. This re-structuring builds on 
recommendations in the Administrative Review & Restructuring (ARR) Report, 
which was shared with you in June 2010.

The re-structuring plan the Board discussed in September requires 
adjusting the titles of existing University Officers and creating one new 
officer.  These changes require amending the Board's University Statutes 
and The General Rules of the University.  Thus, the Board has asked the 
University Senates Conference (and through them, the campus senates) to 
review and consider the amendments.  I'm grateful to the University 
Senates Conference and the campus senates for encouraging your review.  I 
urge you to participate in their meetings and share your thoughts about 
the plan with them.

To aid in the discussion, we've prepared a ""Frequently Asked Questions"" 
(FAQ) document regarding the amendments.  You can find it at:

  http://www.uillinois.edu/arr/documents/Amendments.FAQ.pdf

Should there be additional questions or comments, please bring them to the 
attention of your senate representatives and feel free to send them 
directly to me at presmike@uillinois.edu.  The goal, with limited staff, 
is to update the FAQ a couple of times over the next month.

These are clearly very challenging times and candidly it's unlikely that 
we will see relief soon.  Our Chancellors and the University 
Administration have done an outstanding job of trimming costs on our 
campuses and I recognize the hard work everyone is doing -- often with 
fewer resources.  Yet we must do even more to confront what will certainly 
be additional cuts in our state support.  The Board believes, and I agree, 
that we can manage such cuts only by looking within and across our 
campuses for more efficiencies, greater cost savings, and new revenues.  
This perspective guides the plan the Board is now considering and the 
amendments the plan requires, not to mention our ongoing efforts to 
implement the reforms spelled out in the ARR Report.  By taking a 
University-wide view, we can eliminate unnecessary redundancies and 
relieve the counter-productive burdens those redundancies pose, while 
protecting our core mission, to the extent possible, from the harm that 
can result from further reductions in our state appropriation.  
Additionally, the research coordination and attention to clinical 
oversight that the plan involves present opportunities for substantial new 
revenues. 

In closing, I again thank you for your hard work and commitment to our 
great university.  In the three months that I've had the honor to be your 
president, I've been impressed and humbled by your resolve to meet the 
unprecedented challenges of these difficult times and emerge even stronger 
as a world-class university.  I'm grateful to be a part of this 
outstanding community.

Sincerely,

Mike

 Subject: CRIME-ALERT","Champaign Police and Crime Stoppers are seeking information regarding an 
incident involving attempted robbery and aggravated battery.

On Saturday, October 9th, at approximately 11:46 p.m., the two female 
victims, both 21 years of age, were walking together in the 600 block of 
East Healey Street near Sixth Street. As they crossed Wright Street, they 
observed two male subjects standing on either side of the sidewalk. As 
the females walked down the sidewalk between the two males, the shorter 
of the two males made a comment about robbing them. He struck one of the 
females in the back of the head with an object, but she and the other 
female were able to run away. When they looked back, the two males were 
walking down the sidewalk in the opposite direction, away from the 
victims.

Nothing was taken from either of the victims; however, one of the victims 
suffered a laceration to the back of her head and was transported to 
Carle Hospital for treatment.

The two suspects are described as follows:

- A black male in his 20's, approximately 5'8"" tall and weighing 
approximately 165 lbs., shaved head, brown eyes, and wearing a black 
hooded sweatshirt with a white symbol on the front and black jeans.

- A black or Hispanic male in his 20's, approximately  6' tall and 
weighing approximately 170 lbs., black hair, brown eyes, and wearing 
black baggy clothing.

You are invited to attend a campus-wide Town Hall meeting to be held on
MONDAY, OCTOBER 11, from 3:10-5:15 pm on the third floor of Levis Faculty
Center. This Town Hall meeting is sponsored by the Executive Committee of
the Academic Senate.The meeting is the first of three special meetings
that will be held on campus between this coming Monday and Nov. 1 to
discuss the recent proposals of the Board of Trustees to introduce changes
to the administrative structure of the University and Campus. The proposals
were forwarded by President Hogan, on behalf of the Board, and require the
advice of our campus Senate.The Board has asked that we forward our
advice in time for it to be considered at its Nov. 18 meeting in Chicago.
Briefly and generally, the Board is making two separate but related
proposals: one to add ""Vice President"" to the titles of the three campus
Chancellors; and another proposal to create a Vice President of Health
Affairs, and to change the portfolio of the Vice President of Technology
and Economic Development so that it also includes research, with the
consequent title change. The former change would require an amendment to
the Statutes; the second requires an amendment to the General Rules. The
Town Hall meeting scheduled for Monday, Oct. 11 is designed to provide
background information about current campus and University administrative
structure, information  that is essential in order to fully consider the
proposals. We will also begin to collect questions about the proposals
themselves.Everyone is welcome to attend this Town Hall meeting.

 Subject: CRIME-ALERT","INCIDENT:   Aggravated Robbery
 
OCCURRED:  October 3rd, 2010, 4:00 am

LOCATION:  First Street and Kirby Avenue

BRIEF DETAILS:

The Champaign Police Department received a report of an aggravated 
robbery that occurred near the intersection of First Street and Kirby 
Avenue, Champaign.

On 10-03-10, the Champaign Police Department responded to South First 
Street where they spoke to an individual who was the victim of an 
aggravated robbery.  The victim advised as she was walking northbound on 
First Street, north of Kirby Avenue, she was approached by two  
individuals.  The first individual advised the victim to hand over her 
possessions.  The victim advised the first offender that she only had an 
I.D. on her and she tossed her cell phone into a nearby grassy area.  The 
first offender then punched the victim in the face.  The second offender 
did not say anything to the victim during the attack.  After the victim 
was punched in the face, both offenders fled the area and were not 
located.

OFFENDER DESCRIPTIONS:

The first offender was described as a 20-22 year old black male, 
approximately 5 foot 10 inches tall, weighing approximately 160 pounds, 
wearing a dark hooded athletic jacket that was pulled up over his head.  
The victim could only describe the second offender as a 20-22 year old 
male, approximately 5 foot 7 inches tall, weighing approximately 150 
pounds.  The second offender was also wearing a dark hooded athletic 
jacket that was pulled over his head. 
 
POLICE RESPONSE:

The University of Illinois Police Department is actively working with the 
Champaign Police Department to locate and apprehend the offenders in this 
incident.  Recent arrests have been made in the campus district regarding 
similar types of crimes.

SAFETY INFORMATION:

Members of the campus community are strongly encouraged to follow these 
safety tips to decrease their potential for becoming a victim:
- Stay alert - call the police immediately to report suspicious activity.
- Trust your instincts - if it does not feel right, call for help.
- Avoid walking alone at night.  Travel in groups when possible and 
always walk in well-lit, heavily traveled areas. 
- Turn down your electronic devices. Excessive volume or use of 
electronic devices (iPods, PDAs, cell phones, etc.) can distract you from 
a potential safety hazard.
- Drink responsibly - remember your ability to respond is diminished by 
over-consumption of alcohol.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

Anyone with information about this incident should call the Champaign or 
University of Illinois Police Department.  

Information also can be shared anonymously through Crimestoppers by 
calling 217-373-TIPS or online at:

requiring a police response should be reported to our regional dispatch 
center by calling 9-1-1.

Re:	Important Safety Information

As we have informed you over the past few weeks, several robberies, 
aggravated batteries and assaults have happened near University property. 
We write today to update you on the additional actions our University of 
Illinois Police Department has been taking to help keep our students and 
campus community safe.

Although these crimes have happened primarily in the jurisdiction of the 
Champaign Police Department, we have increased patrols by our own police 
officers in the campus district. This stepped up enforcement includes both 
operations with uniformed and plainclothes officers. We have installed 
additional security cameras throughout the campus. Additionally, we have 
previously authorized the hiring of three additional police officers to 
our department, which will enhance our current efforts. 

Our campus administration and police department maintains contact with 
Champaign City officials and the Champaign Police Department, and we know 
they also have increased police presence in the campus area. Our two 
agencies continue to work together to address these issues, and suspects 
have been apprehended in the past few weeks.  Investigations continue to 
determine if these suspects are associated with previous incidents along 
with apprehending additional offenders.

We continue to encourage students to take advantage of SafeRides and 
SafeWalks, and to follow the safety tips listed here.

-Stay alert. Call the police immediately to report suspicious activity.
-Trust your instincts. If it does not feel right, call for help.
-Avoid walking alone at night. Travel in groups when possible and always 
walk in well-lit, heavily traveled areas. 
-Avoid walking near vacant lots, alleys, construction sites, and wooded 
areas.
-Learn where the campus emergency phones are located and how to use them.
-Learn the best routes between your residence hall and your classes, work 
and activities.
-Take the safest route, not the fastest route. The safest route is usually 
the best lit, most traveled one. 
-Turn down your electronic devices. Excessive volume or use of electronic 
devices (iPods, PDAs, cell phones, etc.) can distract you from a potential 
safety hazard.
-Carry a cell phone, whistle, or a personal alarm to alert people that you 
need help. 
-When you go out, let a friend or roommate know where and with whom you 
will be and when you will be back.
-When on an elevator, be aware of other people. Attempt to stand close to 
the control panel with your back against the elevator wall. If you feel 
threatened or are attacked in the elevator, hit the alarm button and as 
many floor buttons as possible. 

Your safety is our priority.

 Subject: CRIME-ALERT","INCIDENT:     Off Campus Property Armed Robbery  
OCCURRED:     September 11, 2010 at 12:00-12:50 a.m.  
LOCATION:     Third Street and Clark Street, Champaign    

BRIEF DETAILS:  
  
On 09-11-10 at approximately 1:30 am, the Champaign Police Department 
responded to the area of Third Street and Clark Street reference an armed 
robbery that had occurred at that location.  The victim stated while he 
was walking near the intersection of Third Street and Clark Street, he 
was approached by a person who asked him a question that he could not 
hear.  When the victim walked closer to the subject to understand the 
question, the subject punched him in the face.  The victim fought with 
the offender who punched him in the face.  Four other offenders who were 
apparently in the area also battered the victim.  While fighting with the 
offenders, the victim advised that one of the offenders pulled a small 
black handgun from his pocket and ordered him to surrender his money.  
The offenders then made the victim get on the ground where they kicked 
and punched him several times.  The offenders then fled the area and were 
not located.  The victim was not injured in the incident.
  
OFFENDER DESCRIPTIONS:  

The victim described all the offenders as black males, approximately 6 
feet tall with average to skinny builds.  The victim advised each 
offender was wearing a different colored hooded sweatshirt.  The offender 
who displayed the handgun was described as wearing an orange hooded 
sweatshirt.  

POLICE RESPONSE:

The University of Illinois Police Department is committed to taking all 
appropriate measures to eliminate these acts of violence that have been 
occurring in the campus district.  We have been deploying additional 
officers on overtime to increase our patrol presence in the campus 
district.  Thanks to a continued commitment from the Chancellor?s Office, 
we have recently installed 100 security cameras throughout campus which 
will enable us to better identify and apprehend offenders.  We have also 
been working collaboratively with the Champaign Police Department and 
their assigned campus details in order to provide a unified approach to 
aggressively address these acts of violence.

SAFETY INFORMATION:

Members of the campus community are strongly encouraged to follow these 
safety tips to decrease their potential for becoming a victim:
- Stay alert - call the police immediately to report suspicious activity.
- Trust your instincts - if it doesn?t feel right, call for help.
- Avoid walking alone at night.  Travel in groups when possible and 
always walk in well-lit, heavily traveled areas. 
- Turn down your electronic devices. Excessive volume or use of 
electronic devices (iPods, PDAs, cell phones, etc.) can distract you from 
a potential safety hazard.
- Drink responsibly - remember your ability to respond is diminished by 
over-consumption of alcohol.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

Anyone with information about these incidents should call the Champaign 
Police Department at 217-351-4545.  Information also can be shared 
anonymously through Crimestoppers by calling 217-373-TIPS or online at:

TO:      Urbana-Champaign Faculty
FROM:    Andreas Cangellaris, Chair, Senate Committee on Honorary Degrees
RE:      Request for Nominations for Honorary Degrees
 
The Senate Committee on Honorary Degrees is pleased to invite nominations 
for the May 2012 honorary degree awards.  Nomination procedures are 
detailed below.  You are urged to nominate, through your unit (department, 
school, college, etc.), outstanding candidates for Honorary Degree 
awards.  
 
The committee requests that nominations and supporting materials for the 
May 2012 commencement be submitted by October 15. Please note that in 
order to maintain absolute confidentiality, under no circumstances is any 
potential candidate to be contacted even to obtain lists of references 
and/or vitae.  Please use only non-University of Illinois persons for 
references.  Only the President and/or Chancellor may contact candidates.
 
The Committee appreciates your help in identifying outstanding individuals 
whom the University can honor and, in so doing, honor itself.  If you have 
any questions or need additional information, please contact the Senate 
Office (333-6805).  For your convenience, a nomination form is at 
(http://www.senate.illinois.edu/hd_form.pdf). 
 
REQUEST FOR NOMINATIONS FOR HONORARY DEGREES
 
The prime, controlling consideration should be distinction.  The person 
should have made a distinguished contribution to knowledge and creativity 
in the relevant field of endeavor, and have shown sustained activity of 
uncommon merit.  The contributions may be made in a wide range of 
activities; the following list is not exhaustive:
 
- Scholarship, in any discipline:  major breakthroughs in knowledge in 
fields of scholarly work.
- Creative Arts, in the broad sense of the term:  literature, music, 
architecture, engineering, et al; the development of new frontiers of 
creativity.
- Professions:  distinguished contributions, innovative work of 
distinction.
- Public Service:  outstanding achievement in statesmanship, 
administration, legislative activity, the judiciary, or in non-
governmental civic activities.
- Business, Industry and Labor:  outstanding, innovative activity in the 
business and/or labor community.
 
Following Senate guidelines (www.senate.illinois.edu/criteria.asp), the 
Committee will consider, but not be bound by, the degree to which the 
candidate has had some association with Illinois - the University or the 
State.  While alumni of the University should not be excluded, honorary 
degrees are not a means of recognizing their contributions; other awards 
exist for this purpose.  Current administrators, faculty, or staff of the 
University ordinarily are not eligible; while emeriti are eligible even if 
engaged in teaching or research at the University.  Elected officials of 
the State of Illinois and its subordinate units and members of the 
Legislature, during their terms of office, ordinarily are not eligible.
 
Senate guidelines emphasize recommendations by departments and other 
academic units.  A nomination coming to the Committee from a member of the 
Board of Trustees, an alumnus/alumna or friend of the University, will be 
referred to the proper academic unit for support of the faculty.
 
For full consideration by the Committee, the nominator or nominating unit 
should supply the following information to the Committee by October 15:
 
1.     A brief letter of nomination, summarizing the candidate's 
qualifications for this honor, and certifying the support of the 
appropriate academic unit.
 
2.     A brief curriculum vitae of the nominee, including addresses, 
telephone numbers, or other means by which the nominee can be reached.  If 
the nomination finds substantial initial support in the Honorary Degrees 
Committee, additional information may be requested from the department to 
develop the case and to provide the Senate with the materials it needs for 
the final decision.
 
3.     The names and addresses of at least four professionally-
distinguished individuals who could be contacted for letters of support or 
further information about the candidate.  It is hoped that oral 
communications among professional colleagues will help assure the 
confidentiality of the decision process.
 
Nominations and full dossiers should be marked confidential and sent to 
the Committee on Honorary Degrees, c/o Senate Office, 228 English 
Building, MC-461 (familler@illinois.edu).

To:	Members of the Campus Community

From:	Robert A. Easter
	Chancellor and Provost (Interim)

Re:	Reaffirmation of Equal Employment Opportunity

At the start of each academic year, I have the privilege of reaffirming 
the University of Illinois' commitment to equal opportunity, consistent 
with University policy and federal and state regulations. 

The University, as reflected by Inclusive Illinois, is committed to 
creating and maintaining a community that recognizes and values the 
inherent worth and dignity of every person, while fostering an environment 
of mutual respect among its members.  The University takes seriously our 
responsibility to provide leadership in ensuring that equal employment 
opportunity is our standard practice rather than an aspiration.  As such, 
University policy prohibits discrimination or harassment of any member of 
the campus community in any employment practice, including recruitment, 
selection, promotion, transfer, merit increases, salary, training and 
development, demotion, and separation on the basis of race, color, 
religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, order of protection status, 
genetic information, marital status, disability, sexual orientation 
including gender identity, unfavorable discharge from the military or 
status as a protected veteran.  The policy is available online at 
http://oeoa.illinois.edu/campusconduct.html.  

Additionally, the University remains committed to the principles of 
affirmative action and equal access for women, minorities, persons with 
disabilities, and protected veterans.  The Campus Affirmative Action Plan 
describes the policies and procedures that must be followed in furtherance 
of these principles.  All employees are responsible for promoting equal 
employment opportunity and for making good faith efforts to achieve the 
university's affirmative action goals.  

The Office of Equal Opportunity and Access is a resource for the campus in 
matters of equal opportunity, affirmative action, and nondiscrimination in 
employment.  OEOA is available to address any campus concerns involving 
these matters. As always, your commitment to a respectful living, 
learning, and working community at Illinois is acknowledged and 
appreciated.

Dear Colleagues,

In order to optimize support for campus research efforts, I have 
reallocated staff resources in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for 
Research to provide additional support for new initiatives and the pursuit 
of large interdisciplinary funded projects.  Reallocating the effort 
previously devoted to International Research Relations will allow us to 
appoint two 50% Associate Vice Chancellors for Research.
   
An Associate Vice Chancellor focused on New Research Initiatives will work 
to develop funding relationships with federal funding agencies, non-
governmental organizations, and private foundations, in order to launch 
new initiatives in these areas. This individual will be responsible for 
collaboration with International Programs and Studies in pursuing 
international research opportunities, including a new focus on agriculture 
and information technology.

The regulatory environment for research compliance has become increasingly 
demanding.  Improved service to researchers is needed to facilitate 
compliance while minimizing the time and effort that investigators devote 
to compliance issues. An Associate Vice Chancellor focused on Compliance 
will spearhead our efforts to improve services to researchers and 
facilitate compliance.
  
The position descriptions for each of these positions are available at 
http://research.illinois.edu/avcr.asp.  By serving in these positions, 
faculty will have an opportunity to develop administrative skills with the 
potential to advance their careers. They will also provide leadership for 
a number of other activities in the OVCR.  I encourage your consideration 
of this opportunity, as well as nominations of your colleagues.  I hope 
you will pass this information on to others who may be interested in these 
positions.  We would appreciate receiving all applications or nominations 
by September 24. Funding for an appropriate teaching release in the home 
unit will be provided for each of these individuals.
  
I am very appreciative of your consideration of these positions, and hope 
that you will consider serving in this capacity or nominating others.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Annual Message on Res Integrity Policies-Fall 2010","To:  Faculty, staff, and students who conduct research
 
From:  Ravi Iyer, Interim Vice Chancellor for Research
 
For compliance purposes, federal and state sponsors of research require 
that all faculty, staff, and students engaged in sponsored research be 
informed regularly about campus policies on research integrity.

The University-wide procedures for addressing particular instances of 
unethical conduct in research and publication are available on the Web at: 

http://www.vpaa.uillinois.edu/Policies/integrityresearch/index.cfm

Under this policy, all members of the University community are expected to 
observe high standards of academic integrity and ethical behavior in 
research and publication.  Any practice or conduct by a member of the 
University community that seriously deviates from those ethical standards 
for proposing, conducting, and publishing research that are commonly 
accepted within the professional community constitutes academic misconduct 
in violation of University policy.
 
Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to:

a. Fabrication or falsification of data, including intentionally 
misleading, selective, or deliberately false reporting of credentials or 
other academically related information;
b. Unacknowledged appropriation of the work of others, including 
plagiarism, the abuse of confidentiality with respect to unpublished 
materials, or misappropriation of physical materials;
c. Evasion of or intentional failure after notice by the University or 
federal, state, or another appropriate agency to comply with research 
regulations or requirements, including but not limited to those applying 
to human subjects, laboratory animals, new drugs, radioactive materials, 
genetically altered organisms, and to safety; and
d. Other conduct which seriously deviates from accepted ethical standards 
in scholarship.

In addition, as part of the America Competes Act, the NSF has implemented 
a responsible conduct of research (RCR) training requirement for 
undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers supported by NSF 
funding.  The respective PI's are responsible for identifying personnel 
supported by NSF grants that require RCR training, as well as documenting 
the specific training provided and completion date for each individual. 
Please note RCR training module within the Collaborative Institutional 
Training Initiative (CITI) is now available to UIUC researchers as one 
option for completing this requirement.  This utility has been customized 
for use by campus personnel according to their interests/specialties in 
the biomedical, social and behavioral, physical sciences, or humanities 
disciplines.  Each course includes basic required modules, plus a number 
of electives in a variety of interest areas.  Upon completion, the 
participant may print a completion report.  The latter will be useful in 
cases where certified training is required, such as for the NSF or other 
college/department applications.  The condensed instructions for the CITI 
module are enclosed below.

Other related information:

The official campus statement on ""Responsible Professional Conduct:  
Guidelines for Teaching, Research, and Service"" is printed in the ACADEMIC 
STAFF HANDBOOK, available on the Web at:

Re:	Welcome Back

	We write to welcome you back for Academic Year 2010-2011 and also 
to update you on some of the campus activities that have taken place over 
the summer and to provide you with the most current status of our fiscal 
situation.
	To date, we have charged 17 Stewarding Excellence @ Illinois 
Project Teams, 16 of which have submitted reports.  To learn more about 
each project, visit http://oc.illinois.edu/budget/projectteams.html. We 
are grateful for the hard work of the project teams and to the campus 
community, who demonstrated their thoughtful engagement with this process 
through their public comments. It is heartening that faculty, staff, 
students, and the public care so deeply about our institution and are 
committed to our continued excellence.
	Nine projects have completed the initial feedback process and have 
been submitted to the Office of the Chancellor and the Office of the Vice 
Chancellor for Academic Affairs. Our staff has reviewed those documents 
and has consulted broadly with the Council of Deans, Faculty Senate, 
student leaders, and the Campus Advisory Committee to identify short-term 
and long-term actionable items. We have carefully considered the public 
comments and the unit responses and incorporated those diverse 
perspectives and ideas in our decision-making process. In the days and 
weeks to come, we will tell you about the solutions we will implement this 
fall that will produce change on our campus that achieve both cost-savings 
and institutional transformation that will protect the quality for which 
we are known and better position the University to meet the current and 
future needs of our students, our state and the larger community.  We will 
also launch new projects early this academic year as we continue the 
activities of Stewarding Excellence.  Our objective remains to minimize 
the stress from this difficult financial time while transforming the 
institution for a bright future.  
	As we begin a new academic year, we continue to face the 
extraordinary financial challenges that we encountered in Fiscal Year 2010 
due, in large part, to the serious fiscal problems of the state of 
Illinois.  As of this writing, the State owes the University $119 million 
for FY 2010 (which ended June 30, 2010) and $122 million that has already 
been billed for this fiscal year.   In light of questions about the level 
of state support we might receive and an uncertain national economic 
recovery, we have taken steps to make the institution more fiscally nimble 
without compromising our core values.
	One of those steps was to offer voluntary programs to reduce our 
workforce.  More than 500 employees took advantage of our Voluntary 
Separation Incentive Program, and some 90 tenured faculty members and 16 
adjunct professors and lecturers will leave the University under the 
Voluntary Retirement Incentive Program. Achieving this reduction in staff 
through voluntary programs minimized the dislocation and disruption that 
would have resulted from more drastic measures.  We thank you for your 
patience and cooperation as we adjust to the reality of a smaller 
workforce.  We believe that these are significant short-term actions that 
position us more favorably for the future.
	Although some of the employees who participated in these voluntary 
separation programs will be replaced, most will not. We continue to 
carefully monitor these and any hiring requests to ensure that approvals 
to hire are based on demonstrated strategic or operational needs and 
further the campus' commitment to a diverse workforce.  Additionally, 
because of the talent of our current workforce, we restrict necessary 
hiring to internal applicants whenever appropriate.  
	We are mindful that our great faculty remain attractive prospects 
for other institutions. Illinois is strong because, for 143 years, we have 
provided a nurturing and supportive environment for faculty to teach and 
engage in their research.  In an effort to retain our stellar faculty, we 
are working with the Council of Deans and department heads to proactively 
demonstrate our commitment to provide our faculty with competitive 
compensation, a productive working environment, and outstanding research 
support.  To this end, we have taken measures to retain faculty and those 
staff who we were at risk of losing to other institutions.   
	On Monday, August 23, classes began.  During our Convocation this 
year we welcomed 7,000 first-year students to Illinois - our Class of 
2014.  They, along with returning, transfer, graduate and professional 
students will comprise a projected total enrollment of approximately 
42,000 students on our campus.  Our students come not only from Illinois, 
but also from throughout the United States and the world.
	Thank you for your tremendous contribution to our institution.  We 
wish you a productive academic year.

sheet of paper are already becoming best friends. Classes have started, 
bringing the welcome bustle of students as they dash from one to the next.

The new school year has been especially energizing for me this year, my 
first as president. For one, there are more students this fall than last -
 nearly 73,000 combined on our three campuses - again proving the 
excellence and value that have made us one of the nation's top public 
universities. And, our faculty and staff are rising to new heights in 
their research, scholarship, and creative works.

The return of our students is also a reminder of the limitless 
possibilities of education. University of Illinois graduates may someday 
cure diseases, revolutionize technology, or add a new classic to American 
literature. That potential serves as a call to me, and my faculty and 
staff colleagues, to steward the resources needed to pursue greatness.

We face financial challenges, but I want to make sure that cloud doesn't 
overshadow our everyday achievements, from cutting-edge research to 
student, faculty, and staff excellence. So I'm celebrating those 
accomplishments - along with some of the plain old fun that rounds out 
the college experience - in my new blog, PrezRelease. Please check it out

 Subject: CRIME-ALERT","The University of Illinois Police Department has recently received 
information from the Champaign Police Department about an Aggravated 
Battery that occurred on August 18, 2010 at approximately 3:10 a.m. in 
the 600 block of South Fourth Street, Champaign.

The victim, a twenty-one year old male, was walking on the sidewalk in 
the area of Fourth Street and Healey Street when he was approached by 
three individuals.  One of these individuals asked the victim if he had a 
lighter.  The victim went to retrieve his lighter when he was struck in 
the face by this offender.  The victim attempted to flee the area when he 
was chased by the other two suspects and knocked to the ground.  While on 
the ground, the offenders kicked and punched the victim.  The offenders 
then ran northbound on Fourth Street.

The victim was then approached by two unknown males and a female asking 
if he needed assistance.  These two unknown males also ran after the 
three offenders.

The offenders were described as black males between the ages of 18 to 25 
years old.  One offender was described as having a slender build, 5'10"" 
tall, 180 lbs. with a light complexion and dark hair.  Another offender 
was also described as having a light complexion.  These are the only 
descriptors the victim could provide.  However, the tactic used by these 
offenders is similar to other offenses committed in the campus district.

Therefore, the University and Champaign Police caution the community to 
be suspicious of groups of male subjects approaching individuals walking 
alone at night and asking to borrow a lighter, cell phone, or other 
property as this appears to be a tactic to allow the opportunity to 
commit a crime.  

The victim received minor injuries from this incident including abrasions.

Anyone with information about this incident particularly those that 
approached the victim and rendered assistance should call the Champaign 
Police Department at 217-351-4545.  Information also can be shared 
anonymously through Crimestoppers by calling 217-373-TIPS or online at:

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Dramatic Communications Technology Changes to Come","TO: Illinois Faculty

FROM: Sally Jackson, Chief Information Officer and Associate Provost, and
Panit Lisy, Executive Director, CITES

RE: Dramatic Communications Technology Changes to Come

Dear Colleagues:

Communication technology has changed dramatically over the past
quarter-century, and especially over the past few years. Campus now has an
opportunity to rethink how we deliver common IT services related to human
communication, including email, calendaring, telephone service, voice mail,
conferencing, and instant messaging. Currently, we have multiple email and
calendaring platforms hosted by central IT departments and by colleges and
business units. Each form of communication has different technical
underpinnings, and for any one form there may be multiple providers of the
service. We can do much better than this, leveraging our world-class data
network and exciting new advances in communication and collaboration tools.

Many universities have already migrated from old-fashioned telephony to
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), using special telephone switches and
phone sets on the data network infrastructure. CITES did an extensive study
of VoIP technologies before concluding last year that the high cost for
this incremental advancement was not justifiable. Technology has continued
to advance, however, and the current trend is not merely to run voice
service over data infrastructure, but to actually converge many different
communication tools as part of a common system. Strongly motivated by the
pressure of the current financial crisis, campus IT professionals have
discovered a path toward massively improved communication support that is
not only affordable, but actually saves money as compared with what we
spend now. Among the ways of moving forward toward a state-of-the-art
?unified communications? environment, one stands out for its cost
advantages to campus: using Microsoft software tools available under a
Campus Agreement to all faculty, staff, and graduate/professional students.

The purpose of this memo is to inform the campus that CITES is moving
forward with implementation of a Microsoft-based solution to unified
communications, acting on a consensus among campus IT leaders and in
accordance with recommendations of the Stewarding Excellence project team
assigned to review IT@Illinois initiatives. This one new service will
replace many existing services, integrating phone, voice mail, email,
calendaring, instant messaging, and conferencing. The resulting flexibility
makes it possible for people to choose how they want to receive
communications (e.g., voice mail messages can be accessed through email),
and to specify how available they want to be to incoming communications
(e.g., during a meeting they might want to receive no messages or only
certain types of messages, or while traveling they might have calls to
their office phone routed to their mobile phone). 

Dramatic hard-dollar cost savings result from this move, through reduction
and gradual elimination of our legacy voice system. By 2013, we expect to
reduce the real cost of human communication services to the campus by
$3,000,000 yearly?while leaping forward to a much richer communication and
collaboration environment. 

This is a game-changer for voice service, but there are some downsides to
go along with the considerable upsides.  The most important downside is
that in unifying all of these services, we become slightly more vulnerable
to interruptions of all services at once. Traditional voice service
operates at a standard of reliability known in the industry as ?five
nines?: This means that 99.999% of the time, when you pick up the phone you
get a dial tone. By supporting all communication services on a common
infrastructure and common software application, we risk losing voice
service whenever we experience a network outage?still very uncommon, but
not yet a five-nines technology. We will also experience transitional costs
as people get used to the new capabilities of unified communications and
adapt to new devices. Our technical staff and other colleagues are already
thinking about how to minimize the risks and the transitional costs. We
will stop pressing forward if at any point we see that the downsides are
unmanageable. 

Because of the size of savings we expect to receive from this and the
exigency of our financial situation, we are moving forward with less
deliberation than a change of this magnitude would normally warrant. What
we can tell you is that this has been thoroughly studied by a small but
diverse number of colleagues, including IT leaders from all major academic
units, technical experts in CITES and other units, and faculty members
charged with reviewing unified communications as a cost reduction strategy
under Stewarding Excellence. Nearly all who have actually studied this
opportunity, including many who started as skeptics, have come to the
conclusion that the benefits are worth the modest trade-offs. We assume
that most others will ultimately come to the same conclusion, so we are
moving forward, but paying close attention to any new issues that arise.

Demos of the UC system will be available to campus starting next month, in
which the new capabilities that we can expect will be shown. Please mark
your calendar for August 10.  You will receive more details about the demos
soon. (If you are unable to make the August 10 sessions, other demos will
be scheduled for this fall.)

For further information about why this decision was made, please visit the
Stewarding Excellence website and choose IT@Illinois. For more information
about the technology or the project, please contact Panit Lisy,
plisy@illinois.edu, or Charley Kline, kline@illinois.edu. A Unified
Communications project website also will be available soon.

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has long been a national 
leader and pioneer in providing access and accommodations for individuals 
with disabilities.  Our renovated Nugent Hall continues that leadership 
by providing accessibility that goes beyond the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements.  Nugent Hall will now accommodate 
students with severe physical disabilities who currently reside in 
Beckwith Hall. 

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is proud to partner with 
organizations, agencies, companies and other educational institutions in 
celebrating the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA).  Illinois celebrates and recognizes the progress 
that has been made by reaffirming the principals of equality and 
inclusion and recommitting our efforts to reach full ADA compliance.  For 
more information, please visit the following website:  
http://www.2010anniversary.org/.  I encourage all units to continue their 
work to improve access for students, faculty, staff and visitors to our 
campus to meet the spirit of the ADA.

I'm delighted to be starting my first day at the University of Illinois.

Virginia and I appreciate the warm welcome you've given us during our 
transition to the University and back to the Midwest.

We've heard from many of you since the announcement of my appointment as 
president, and I want you to know that I'm grateful for your support, 
your ideas, and your good wishes for our success together.

Let's never lose sight of the fact that in its long and distinguished 
history, the University of Illinois and its people have accomplished 
great things and remain at the pinnacle of American higher education. We 
have much more to accomplish together. 

There are significant challenges ahead, but the University of Illinois 
has among the nation's finest faculty, staff, students and alumni. We 
cannot, and will not, permit these difficult economic times to deter us 
from setting our sights high as we start the University's next chapter. 
Our expertise, innovation, resilience, and commitment to enhancing the 
well-being of the people of this state - and the world - will help us 
rise to these challenges.

The University is an incredible asset to Illinois and one that can help 
the state get back on track. 

Starting today, I'll be engaged in a kind of ""listening tour"" to learn 
more about the opportunities and challenges we can address together. I 
hope to meet as many of you as possible so that I can hear your thoughts, 
ideas, and suggestions.

The Midwest has always been our home. I can't tell you how happy Virginia 
and I are to be returning to our roots, near our family, in the land and 
among the people we treasure.

July 1st is more than my first day on the job. It is also the 15th 
anniversary of the Springfield campus joining the University of Illinois. 
The evolution of our university is one of growth, change, and achievement.

The University of Illinois is a great university in a great state. We're 
proud to be the newest members of the University of Illinois family.

Sincerely,

Mike Hogan

 Subject: Adm Review and Restructuring (ARR) final report","Dear Colleagues,

I am deeply grateful to the members of the Administrative Review and 
Restructuring Work Group for their effort and commitment to the 
challenging task placed in front of them last November. The group was 
ably led by Dr. Craig Bazzani and Dr. Avijit Ghosh and I wish to express 
my special appreciation to them and to each of the members of the work 
group. The aim was - and remains - the identification of avenues to 
improve service while reducing costs. Doing that will not be easy, but 
events of the last year and the fiscal and political landscape that lie 
ahead make it even more crucial than when we began.

The real challenge, however, is one of execution. Good ideas and 
recommendations are useless sitting on the shelf, gathering dust 
alongside other well-intentioned efforts in the past. The work group 
presents forty-three recommendations across organizational and functional 
areas which need more study and refinement, but they also require action.

In May, I brought to the Board of Trustees the work group's proposal that 
the positions of Vice President for Academic Affairs and Vice President 
for Technology and Economic Development be consolidated and the Board 
approved the recommendation. Additional steps, including needed changes 
in the General Rules, await the arrival of President Michael Hogan in 
July. This initial step, however, is intended to signal a much broader 
opportunity to improve functioning by reducing the number of senior 
executive positions at all levels, reducing layers of management, and 
capturing the synergies to improve performance.

Another key recommendation of the work group is to craft stronger 
partnerships among the Foundation, Alumni Association and other 
externally facing ""University advancement and development"" functions. 
This recommendation has the support of the respective boards and has 
never been more important and urgent given the difficult economic and 
political times we are experiencing. 

We can and must capture savings in the information technology and 
procurement areas across the entire University. Examples include 
consolidation of data centers, e-mail and calendaring services and a 
centrally-led procurement model which maximizes strategic purchases for 
high-usage supplies and services. 

As the work group observed, talented, dedicated people are the 
University's most precious asset. Still, there is no one point in the 
University at which human resource policies are monitored and managed. 
The consequence is an outdated, rule-driven system of personnel policies 
and decisions. We must be smarter and do better. While the work group did 
not hire outside consultants, as we move into the implementation phase, 
such assistance may be necessary. The need for improved human resource 
policies and systems presents a case in point.

A parallel effort of academic program review has been occurring on each 
campus. The Chancellors are leading a review of academic priorities, 
structures, processes, and policies. I make special note of these efforts 
since academic transformation may be even more challenging than the 
administrative reform, but it carries even greater long-term significance.

None of these steps will be easy. Change will not occur overnight but it 
must occur promptly. The University must achieve the savings and 
improvements now. As I leave the presidency, President Hogan has asked me 
to accept personal responsibility for guiding these efforts and I have 
agreed to do so. I will form a small implementation team to facilitate 
review and consultation and will advise President Hogan and the 
Chancellors regarding next steps. I will also meet with the University 
Senates Conference and others, including the Board of Trustees, to seek 
their support and advice. 

Above all, the University must control its destiny and safeguard its 
future. Each of us can and must contribute to this transformation. The 
work group's report is posted at www.uillinois.edu/arr/Reports/. Your 
ideas and suggestions are needed and welcome.

It has been my privilege to serve as your President for the past six 
months. More than you will ever know, I thank you for your confidence and 
support. I look forward to being your colleague in the months and years 
ahead. For all you contribute to the University of Illinois, I am deeply 
grateful.

Stanley O. Ikenberry
President

the University of Illinois has concluded. I'm delighted to announce that 
the Board's choice to become the 18th president of the University of 
Illinois is Dr. Michael J. Hogan, president of the University of 
Connecticut.  

The Search Committee to Assist the Board in the Selection of a President 
and the Board of Trustees sought a seasoned, highly capable leader, a 
person with experience in working productively with an incredibly broad 
range of academic disciplines and programs, a person with success in 
gaining support from public and private sources, one with sophistication 
in dealing with external publics, a person with the highest ethical 
standards, and one capable of working with the many challenges and 
opportunities the University of Illinois presents.

Dr. Hogan exemplifies all of these qualities. He is a rare find and a top-
flight leader capable of moving the University forward.  

Search Process

The search process that led us to Dr. Hogan was extensive and 
comprehensive. I commend Pam Strobel, a University of Illinois Trustee, 
alumna, and a former Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative 
Officer of Exelon, who chaired the search committee. Pam deserves special 
recognition for her hard work and dedication to the search process, as 
does Dr. May Berenbaum, professor of entomology, College of Liberal Arts 
and Sciences, Urbana, who served as vice chair of the committee. Without 
the skill and the hard work of the search committee members and the long 
hours they invested in reviewing records of prospective candidates and 
interviewing semifinalists, the quest would not have been nearly as 
smooth or successful.  

Seasoned Leader 

Michael Hogan's entire career has prepared him to lead a major public 
university. He has held nearly every management and executive position in 
academia, steadily rising through the ranks on the merits of his 
scholarship, commitment and leadership.

It should be noted that Dr. Hogan is no stranger to the Midwest. While he 
spent the early years of his career as a faculty member at Stony Brook 
University, the University of Texas and Miami University, he quickly 
moved to a professorship at The Ohio State University, later serving as 
chair of the department of history, then dean of the college of 
humanities, and finally as executive dean of the college of arts and 
sciences. 

In 2004, Dr. Hogan returned to the institution that conferred upon him 
his Master's and Ph.D. degrees, the University of Iowa, to serve as 
executive vice president and provost and as the F. Wendell Miller 
Professor of History.  

Distinguished Scholar

Dr. Hogan is a well recognized scholar and specialist in the history of 
American Diplomacy and American Foreign Relations. He is the author or 
editor of nine books, including: Informal Entente: The Private Structure 
of Cooperation in Anglo-American Economic Diplomacy, 1918-1928 
(University of Missouri, 1977); The Marshall Plan: America, Britain, and 
the Reconstruction of Western Europe, 1947-1952 (Cambridge University 
Press), which is widely considered the definitive work concerning the 
reconstruction of Western Europe following World War II, and for which 
Dr. Hogan received the Stuart L. Bernath Book Award of the Society for 
Historians of American Foreign Relations, the George Louis Beer Prize of 
the American Historical Association, and the Quincy Wright Prize of the 
International Studies Association; A Cross of Iron: Harry S. Truman and 
the Origins of the National Security State, 1945-1954 (Cambridge 
University Press, 1998); and Paths to Power; The Historiography of 
American Foreign Relations to 1941 (Cambridge University Press, 2000).  

Dr. Hogan has been a fellow of the Harry S. Truman Library Institute and 
the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and has served as 
Louis Martin Sears Distinguished Professor of History at Purdue 
University. His scholarship has been recognized by the Society for 
Historians of American Foreign Relations, which awarded him the Bernath 
Lecture Prize in 1984, and The Ohio State University, which presented him 
its Distinguished Scholar Award in 1990, the highest award for scholarly 
distinction conferred on members of the faculty.   

Breadth of Experience

During his tenure at the University of Iowa and at the University of 
Connecticut, Dr. Hogan gained a reputation for being a hands-on 
administrator, always receptive to dialogue with students. During his 
first week as President of UConn, Dr. Hogan joined a student field trip 
with a group of 44 honors students. As Melissa Bruen, a field trip 
participant and former editor-in-chief of the student newspaper put 
it: ""He definitely made an effort...to talk to students individually, 
just to say, 'I'm here, you can talk to me'...he was very open and honest 
about things."" 

Dr. Hogan publishes a blog, PresRelease, on the university's website as a 
way to communicate with faculty and students. On a more whimsical note, 
Hogan demonstrated his courage (and perhaps his humility) by taking to 
the dance floor in a ""Dancing with the Stars"" style event hosted by the 
Jorgensen Center for the Performing Arts at UConn. 

As president of the University of Connecticut, Dr. Hogan has worked 
closely with the Connecticut state legislature, the Governor's office and 
the federal government to secure funding for a variety of crucial 
projects. Dr. Hogan has been an active friend and fundraiser, as well as 
a leader and supporter of UConn's $600 million campaign, ""Our University, 
Our Moment."" 

Dr. Hogan's most recent and perhaps most significant achievement is the 
new UConn Health Network. The $352 million plan includes a new patient 
care tower and renovations to the university's hospital. 

Throughout his career, Michael Hogan has distinguished himself as one of 
the most intelligent, personable and passionate university administrators 
in the country. His honesty, integrity and perseverance have made him a 
legend at every university he has served.    

I hope you will join me in welcoming President and Mrs. Hogan to the 
University of Illinois family.

verify their ethnicity and race using the new standards.

On behalf of the University of Illinois, I request that you verify your 
ethnicity and race information.  Your existing ethnicity and race data has 
been converted from the current values to the new values.  Please confirm 
and update this data by following the directions provided at

Re:     	The University of Illinois celebrates National Bike Month 
this May.

Bicycling is an excellent mode of transportation in Champaign-Urbana. On 
our campus, you can expect a minimum of 5,000 cyclists are present on any 
given day. The safety of pedestrians, cyclists and motorists is a campus 
priority and we are mindful of that as we celebrate National Bike Month. 

How to Celebrate National Bike Month:

- Participate in the first community-wide C-U Bike to Work Day, Tuesday, 
May 4, 2010. For free event registration, to volunteer or for more 
information about the event, visit: 
.

- Provide input about improvements for bike parking around campus by May 
22, 2010. Choose campus locations that need new or improved bike parking 
via an online survey at: .  

- Join the Campus Bike Project. Members can repair their old bike, 
purchase a used bike, learn more about cycling, or volunteer to assist 
others. For more information, visit: 


- Share a bike on campus. The Illinois Cross-Campus Bicycle program 
provided six bicycles on campus for use by employees as a pilot program. 
Interested departments should contact the Transportation Demand Management 
office at fandscampustdm@fs.illinois.edu or 217-333-2668. 

Bicycling is supported and encouraged on our campus and in the Champaign-
Urbana area. Remember that cyclists, drivers, and pedestrians must follow 
the Rules of the Road so we can all safely travel the campus. HAVE FUN and 
BE SAFE!",University to Celebrate National Bike Month

signature definition file (known as a ""DAT"") which contained a bug. This
bug caused a number of computers running Windows XP to appear to be

McAfee customers nationally.

Computers affected by the buggy DAT may reboot frequently or report the

I wanted to write and encourage you to complete and mail your Census forms, which should not 
take more than ten minutes. 

If you didn't already know, the 10-question form should be filled for the address where you will 
be residing on April 1st - most likely your campus address. Ensuring that most of us submit 
these forms for the campus area will result in increased funding to the community, which may 
improve the following in Champaign-Urbana:

-Condition and maintenance of local streets, sidewalks, and lighting 
-Public transportation
-Local law enforcement 

If you live with others in an apartment, house, fraternity, etc., please make sure that everyone is 
included on the Census Form. 

For more detailed information please visit this site: http://odos.illinois.edu/census/index.asp

I hope you all had an awesome week of fun and relaxation during break! Although my term as

report of an aggravated battery, theft and mob action that occurred at 
approximately 2:00 am near the 400 block of East Green Street in

The victim was walking near the entrance of the Pizza Hut parking lot 
located at 411 East Green Street in Champaign when he was rushed by 3

of the offenders knocked the phone out of his hands.  One of the 
offenders then kicked the victim in his head which apparently rendered 
him unconscious.  Eventually, two witnesses arrived on scene to provide 
assistance to the victim which caused the offenders to flee from the 
scene.

particularly those that would place you in a location of elevated risk as
described by the U.S. State Department Travel Warning.  If you do choose to
travel, please read the recent State Department Travel Warning and its
statement on spring break travel to Mexico which can be found at:

ethnicity and race data.  Because of these changes, the ED is encouraging 
all educational institutions to allow current students and employees to 
verify their ethnicity and race using the new standards.

On behalf of the University of Illinois, I request that you verify your

been converted from the current values to the new values.  Please confirm 
and update this data by following the directions provided at

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Unofficial St. Patrick's Day","Dear Students,

As your student body president, I am reaching out to you at this time in regards to Unofficial St. 
Patrick's Day, which has been an event highly celebrated on our campus for the past several 
years. I am writing in hopes of providing some information that will help you make more 
informed decisions and keep safe, regardless of what you choose to do on Unofficial.  

I have been involved with the campus and community safety planning for Unofficial, and 
University administration and local law enforcement have made it clear that they are extremely 
committed to ensuring that safety and respect of our campus, community, and institution are a 
priority.  

This is a friendly reminder that it is important to understand and abide by the Student Code of 
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to avoid any trouble, not only on Unofficial, but at 
all times.  Here are just a few violations that may be relevant around this time:
   -Behavior which disrupts classroom activity or other normal University function
   -Possession of a false ID or the ID of another in order to enter a liquor establishment or to 
     purchase alcohol
   -Furnishing alcohol to minors
   -Being intoxicated in the roadway or not practicing pedestrian safety 

Although the temptation may be high, I would also suggest that you do not walk around with 
open containers or overload or toss objects off balconies. Violation of the student code and/or 
state and local laws could result in civil or criminal proceedings, as well as dismissal from the 
University.     

Please know that the intent of this email is to not scold or lecture you, but a reminder to be safe 
and avoid any detriment to yourself or others in the community.  If you do see someone in need 
of assistance, I encourage you to do the right thing and help him or her out. Local law 
enforcement will be looking out for our best interests and you can be confident that you will not 
be punished for helping others.  

Be safe, look out for each other, and I'll see you around campus!

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Unofficial St. Patrick's Day - Friday, March 5","On Friday, March 5, 2010, many students and visitors will participate in 
an event known as Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. While the University does 
not support or condone this event, steps are being taken to ensure safety 
and to minimize disruption to classes and campus operations.

The Champaign, Urbana, and University Police Departments, assisted by 
other local and state agencies, will patrol the campus district on March 
5. They will enforce all applicable ordinances in commercial and 
residential areas, and have authority to intervene if private parties 
threaten to disturb the peace. In addition, Champaign and Urbana officials 
will enact restrictions on liquor sales intended to curb overconsumption. 
Emergency medical personnel will be available to provide care.

University police will continue to focus on protecting students, staff, 
faculty, and University property. In case of emergency, call METCAD at 911 
(from campus phones, call 9-911). For non-emergencies, call 333-1216.

As in years past, we have made clear to students that academic business 
will continue as usual on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. That has helped to 
minimize disruptions. Instructors should not need to alter instructional 
plans.

The Student Code (http://www.admin.uiuc.edu/policy/code/) addresses 
student responsibilities on campus. Sections 1-102(d) and 1-302(f) concern 
classroom conduct expectations, and section 1-307 focuses on alcohol 
consumption. The Code empowers instructors to ask disruptive students to 
leave class; after class, names of disruptive students should be reported 
to the Office for Student Conflict Resolution at 333-3680 or online at 
http://www.conflictresolution.uiuc.edu/forms/incidentReport/form.asp.

If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into a 
confrontation, you may seek assistance. From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on March 5, 
teams of Student Affairs and Academic Affairs professionals will walk 
through and around buildings with classrooms and lecture halls where 
disruptions were experienced in the past. Team members, wearing University 
IDs, may be summoned to help. Teams will be prepared to document apparent 
Code violations and to call University police, if necessary.

Students will be asked not to bring any liquids into Foellinger 
Auditorium. (Longstanding policy prohibits liquids and food in Foellinger.)

Students who interfere with the academic mission of the University will 
face serious consequences. Thank you for reinforcing this message before 
and on March 5.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Budget","Dear Colleagues:

As you know, public universities in Illinois are more than $735 million 
behind in receipt of state payments of their total appropriations for the 
fiscal year.

Last week, university and college presidents and chancellors from state-
supported universities across Illinois joined together in asking Governor 
Quinn and Comptroller Hynes to commit to a schedule of state payments to 
forestall further impact on our institutions. We also asked the governor 
and comptroller to commit to swift action to resolve the state's financial 
crisis. A copy of the letter was provided to state lawmakers.

The letter and a news release are available at the URL below. I urge you 
to read this information for additional details on the financial crisis 
and our request:
	
http://www.uillinois.edu/our/news 

On February 9, University of Illinois President Stanley O. Ikenberry spoke 
to the Civic Federation of Chicago about fiscal sustainability in our 
state and at our university. The Civic Federation, a fiscal integrity 
watchdog for more than a century, was an ideal venue for these remarks 
because it hosts the Institute for Illinois' Fiscal Sustainability, a non-
partisan effort to improve decision-making by providing fiscal policy 
analysis. I hope you will take some time to read his remarks. They are 
online at the URL below:

the Spring 2010 Semester.  This is the only time during the Spring 2010 
semester that students can complete an Open Enrollment Reinstatement, 
apply for Dependent Coverage, apply for permanent Exemption from the 
insurance fee, or apply for an Extension of your Fall 2009 coverage. 
Extensions are only for students not registering for the Spring 
Semester.  If you are in an exempt status (not covered under the plan), 
and you wish to remain exempt, you do not need to re-apply for 
exemption.  To check exempt status, look on your e-bill to see if you 
have been charged the UIUC Student Insurance fee (undergrad fee $206.00, 
graduate fee $292.00) If you have not been charged the fee, you are not 
covered by this plan.  Some students may not qualify to be assessed the 
fee.  
Necessary forms and instructions for exemption, extension, and dependent 
coverage can be printed off our web site: www.si.illinois.edu, under

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Update on SURS and Furloughs -- A Positive Step ","Dear Colleagues,

I am writing you today to inform you that representatives from the 
University of Illinois, led by President Ikenberry and the State 
Universities Retirement System (SURS) have agreed to a  manageable method 
of reporting furlough days as formal leaves of absence at SURS for those 
employees required to take furloughs. 
  
As a result, in accordance with SURS statutes, employees who take 
furlough days will now be able to individually purchase the employee 
portion of SURS contributions forfeited while on furlough.  Making up the 
employee contribution to SURS allows an employee to receive service and 
earnings credit for furlough days.

The University and SURS are working together to develop a process for 
employees to make up employee contributions to SURS.  Once the process is 
finalized, we will notify you and will post instructions on the furlough 
website.

Unfortunately, SURS statutes do not provide a mechanism that would allow 
an employee to make up contributions to SURS that are forfeited under the 
voluntary pay reduction option.  As a result, by electing the voluntary 
pay reduction option, an employee will not receive credit for the lost 
pay at SURS and will have no mechanism to do so in the future.

Please be advised that the impact of furlough days or the voluntary pay 
reduction on SURS benefits varies significantly between employees, based 
on years of SURS participation, SURS retirement plan eligibility, 
earnings history, and retirement date.  Employees concerned about the 
impact that furlough days or the voluntary pay reduction may have on SURS 
benefits are urged to consult with SURS.

Employees who have already elected the voluntary pay reduction may revoke 
their election on or before February 8, 2010 at 
.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Faculty Furlough Reporting","There appears to be confusion about reporting responsibilities for faculty 
who choose the furlough option over the temporary pay reduction option.
 
President Ikenberry, in yesterday's Senate meeting, made it completely and 
appropriately clear that faculty members are not required to get 
permission from their department head or chair as they select their 
furlough days. That choice belongs to the faculty member.
 
Please remember, however, that it is extremely important that your 
departmental administration be aware of when you are taking your furlough 
days, particularly if they correspond to days on which you otherwise would 
be in your office or teaching. Your departmental administrator must be 
able to respond knowledgeably to queries about scheduled office hours 
being cancelled or classes not being taught, whether it comes from a 
student who missed a message, an angry parent, or whomever.

RE:        Faculty Nominations to the Athletic Board


The Athletic Board serves as an advisory committee to the Chancellor and 
the Athletic Director on the fiscal and operational aspects of the varsity 
sports program.  The Board is also responsible for that program as it 
relates to the academic and educational objectives defined by the Senate.


The Committee on Committees is seeking nominations from qualified faculty 
members to fill two vacancies on the Athletic Board, created by the 
expiration of the terms of John Erdman and Christopher Span.


Faculty members serve four-year terms.  The following faculty (with 
expiration of terms in parentheses) are continuing on the Board:


C. L. Cole, MEDIA (2011)
Cleo D'Arcy, ACES (2011)
Margaret Kelley, LAS (2013)
Mary Mallory, LIBR (2012)
Thomas Ulen, LAW (2013)


At the February 22, 2010, Senate meeting, the Committee on Committees will 
present a slate of four faculty nominees.  Upon Senate approval of the 
slate, the Chancellor will appoint two of these nominees.


We invite you to make nominations; faculty may also self-nominate.    
Nominations must include a brief (1-2 paragraph) description of the 
qualifications of the nominee, including reference to:


(1)  strengths in service and leadership,
(2)  major teaching and scholarly interests and accomplishments, and
(3)  experiences and interest in the policy and management issues that 
surround a Big Ten athletic program.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Voluntary Pay Reduction Program","Dear Colleagues,
I have appreciated all of your responses and ideas regarding President 
Ikenberry's letter of January 5th to the University, and to my subsequent 
letter to the Urbana campus, announcing furloughs and other difficult 
measures being taken to cope with the growing cash crisis facing the 
University of Illinois as a result of the delay in payment of our state 
appropriation.
  
The feedback I've received regarding our current budget crisis on campus 
has not only been extremely helpful, but it also has confirmed what I've 
always believed: People care deeply and passionately about this 
university. That same constructive feedback led directly to an option to 
furloughs, a voluntary and temporary salary reduction. And we are pleased 
to be able to offer that alternative to our faculty and academic 
professionals. I am writing today to inform you that, as an alternative 
to furloughs, faculty and academic professionals subject to furloughs may 
opt to take a voluntary and temporary salary reduction in lieu of 
furloughs if they so wish. The manner and amount of the salary reduction 
is the same under both options. Those opting for the voluntary pay 
reduction program will not be subject to the work hour restrictions or 
time keeping requirements associated with furloughs. Those who choose not 
to elect the voluntary salary reduction option will, of course, be 
subject to the furlough program.
  
Those who wish voluntarily to elect to take a temporary salary reduction 
in lieu of furloughs must complete an authorization on NESSIE between 
January 26 and February 8, 2010. Please consult the following website for 
more complete information, including the possible impact on SURS 
contributions, and instructions regarding both the mandatory furlough 
program and the voluntary pay reduction program.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Message from the Chancellor re: Finances","Dear Students:

As we approach the spring semester I write to inform you of the current 
financial situation at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 

As is the case with all public universities in the state we currently face 
a cash crisis. In the current fiscal year that commenced on July 1, 2009, 
we have only received 7 percent of our annual appropriation from the 
state. As I write this letter the state of Illinois owes the University 
more than $436 million of its appropriation. That number increases every 
month. 

As a response, we have instituted a number of measures on campus to ensure 
that we have the necessary resources to get through the semester with an 
eye to confronting a similar fiscal shortfall in the next fiscal year. Our 
faculty and administrative staff will begin mandatory furloughs in 
February. (A furlough is a leave of absence without pay.) We have also 
been cutting costs at all levels of the university and we are looking at 
ways we can consolidate services to garner even more savings. Finally, we 
continue to draw on cash reserves, but these are finite and we can no 
longer continue to go down this path.

Please understand that we are doing everything we can to protect our 
students - our number one priority - from the impact of these cost-cutting 
measures. We believe that each fiscal decision we make must not compromise 
the education of this state's greatest assets, its daughters and sons. 

Please share this letter with your parents and family members. Great 
public universities such as ours must be preserved and supported to ensure 
that Illinois and the nation stay competitive in a global economy.

Thank you for your support,

Robert A. Easter

 Subject: Message from Campus Administration","Dear Campus Community:

By now you have read President Ikenberry's letter from Tuesday morning 
sent to staff throughout the University of Illinois. 

The President's message is clear: we must act decisively to offset the 93 
percent shortfall thus far in state appropriations for the fiscal year, 
and to anticipate more long-range stresses on the financial situation that 
supports our fundamental missions. Furloughs address an immediate cash 
need, but they are not an acceptable way of addressing long-term issues.  
Simply stated -- our present commitments exceed the resources that we can 
reasonably expect to have available, and we have no option but to reduce 
expenditures. 

Some decisions will of necessity be made at the campus level, but many 
will have to be made very locally - within departments and colleges. We 
are committed to candid and open conversations that will engage the 
faculty governance process and the academic and civil service staff 
advisory bodies. The decisions we make in the next 12 months will affect 
the nature of this university for decades. Now is the time to act. We 
cannot falter in our resolve.  

Organizations create their future during difficult periods. This is a time 
that will put our intellect and creativity to the test. Our collective 
obligation is to ensure that the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign will emerge from this era as a vigorous, preeminent campus that 
will provide a highly desirable academic home for scholars, students and 
supporting staff. We have done this for 142 years and we will continue to 
do this long past our individual time on this campus. 

Please note that a website is being set up that will address frequently 
asked questions, and will contain more details pertinent to concerns we 
share about meeting the challenges we face. For now, please go here for 
information on furloughs and some additional budget-related material. 
http://www.uillinois.edu/our/news/budget/2010Furlough.cfm.

We are hopeful to have an opportunity to offer voluntary separation plans. 
Look for specifics on those plans within the next two weeks.

Finally, it is clear to us that this is a defining moment in the history 
of this great university. Our mission has not and will not change, but we 
must reinvent the ways in which we deliver on that mission. This is the 
time for thoughtful, positive, and deliberate action and, by coming 
together, we will be defined not by this challenge, but by our response to 
it.

We appreciate all of the work you do to make Illinois the great university 
that it is, and we look forward to addressing these challenges with you.

 Subject: Short-term measures to conserve cash","January 5, 2010

Dear Colleagues and Friends of the University of Illinois,

The University of Illinois is a 142-year-old institution that has 
weathered every challenge and ultimately thrived. We will continue to 
thrive, but we now face a cash crisis triggered by the state's financial 
situation which is grim and worsening. The state budget is out of balance 
with a backlog of unpaid bills nearing $5 billion and short-term borrowing 
covering roughly a comparable amount. The state's credit rating has been 
recently downgraded and among the 50 states only California is worse. 

The consequences for our University and others in this state are 
unprecedented and worsening. In our case, the University of Illinois has 
received only 7% of this year's state appropriation since the first of 
July. The shortfall is more than $400 million and mounting. At some point 
we will be unable to meet payroll and complete the academic year unless 
there are significant payments from the state as promised. My hope is that 
the Governor, leaders and members of the General Assembly will come 
together immediately to address the state's escalating financial crisis. 
As they do so they will have our full support and the support of the 
people of Illinois who understand the tragic consequences of inaction. 

Until we see signs of this financial crisis lifting we must implement the 
following short term measures to conserve cash:

*  Earlier in the fiscal year, we set aside $20 million in reserves and in 
November we directed units to reduce expenditures by 6% to yield an 
additional $45 million. Unfortunately, we now need to use all of this $65 
million to address our immediate cash crisis. While addressing only a 
fraction of our overall shortfall in state payments, this action is 
essential to help sustain the University's payroll. 
	
*  We have struggled this year to avoid furloughs for faculty and staff, 
but that is simply no longer possible. Personnel expenses represent the 
majority of our budget. I am hereby directing the chancellors, deans and 
other University administrators to join me in taking a total of ten 
furlough days -- or two days per month beginning in February and through 
the pay period ending on June 15, 2010. Additionally, I am directing 
faculty members and academic professional staff to take a total of four 
furlough days, beginning in February and through the pay period ending on 
May 15, 2010, or essentially one day per month. A furlough is a temporary 
leave of absence without pay and this measure will contribute $17 million. 
Exceptions to furlough day policies are: employees whose annual base 
salaries are $30,000 or less; graduate assistants and fellows; employees 
with retirement agreements for retirement no later than August 15, 2010; 
and individuals paid 100% from grant or contract funds as of December 15, 
2009. In the case of Civil Service staff, we will seek comparable cost 
reductions in accord with Civil Service rules and bargaining obligations. 

*  The chancellors and I have reinforced an earlier directive to all 
academic and administrative units to avoid, eliminate and/or delay 
expenditures so as to conserve cash. Effective immediately, an absolute 
freeze on all hiring or interim wage increases is declared. Exceptions to 
the hiring freeze, such as hires to honor offers extended by or before the 
date of this letter, commitments required to support specific research and 
contract activities, (e.g. federal stimulus research grant activities), or 
emergency compensation adjustments must be approved by the appropriate 
Chancellor and the President.

Beyond the immediate cash crisis we face significant uncertainties in 
2011. In anticipation of next year's challenges, academic and 
administrative support units should consider issuing notifications of non-
reappointment for selected individuals in employee classes whose terms and 
conditions of employment require advance notice of termination. 

A work group to recommend administrative reorganization and restructuring 
was appointed in mid-November 2009. This group has focused on savings in 
the areas of information technology, purchasing and consolidation of 
administrative support services. I have asked it to provide a preliminary 
report to the Board of Trustees and University Community on January 21. 
Our overall goal must be to preserve the strength of our faculty and 
academic programs by reducing administrative costs.

These are difficult measures and yet they represent an incomplete list of 
steps we must take. We need to take innovative measures not just to ""cut 
budgets"" but to grow revenues and reduce actual costs. At the same time, 
deans, department heads, chairs and faculty must strategically reassess 
the scope of our academic programs and search for opportunities to 
consolidate or cut offerings that we value but may no longer be able to 
afford. In the process, we must protect our core Land-Grant missions of 
teaching, research and service, including clinical care; remain 
competitive for faculty, staff and students; maintain essential services, 
but eliminate duplicate and lower priority activities; consolidate and 
share services and resources; make efficient use of facilities; and take 
such other steps as are necessary to sustain the University's quality and 
continuity of operation long term.

All of these steps are being taken to mitigate the negative impact of the 
state's escalating financial crisis. Unfortunately we cannot anticipate 
when state leaders will act on a plan that reorders priorities and places 
education first, makes the painful but essential cuts in state 
expenditures, and increases state revenues essential to restore the 
financial integrity of this state and its institutions of higher learning. 
As acknowledged repeatedly by many state leaders, education at all levels, 
and especially at the University of Illinois, is the economic engine and 
future of our state and its people. I urge our leaders to act now. 
 
With your help, we will get through this difficult period, determined to 
grow stronger and better. But we will only be able to do that if, like the 
state, we make the painful but essential decisions now. I thank you for 
your understanding and support and I welcome your counsel as we move 
forward.

Stanley O. Ikenberry
President (Interim)

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Chancellor's End-of-Year Message","Dear Campus Community:

As we prepare for a much needed winter break with our families I want to 
thank you for your hard work and dedication. 

We cannot overlook that 2009 has had more than a few challenges, but we 
would be equally remiss in our end-of-the-year review if we did not look 
back with pride on our accomplishments. Our faculty members continue to do 
cutting-edge work that is recognized and praised at the highest national 
and international levels; our grant activity has increased in large part 
because of that recognition; our students graduate with distinction and go 
on to tackle the crucial issues of the day; and our dedicated staff work 
tirelessly to support all of our ambitious activities. 

Yet we cannot and will not ignore the realities. I realize there is 
widespread anxiety regarding our financial state. Soon after the start of 
the next semester President Ikenberry and I will announce measures that 
address the serious budget issues we face.

With each decision we will adhere to principles that have guided this 
great institution for 142 years. We will protect the premium education we 
offer students. We will not backtrack from our other land grant mandates 
of research and outreach. Nor will we not step back from addressing the 
grand challenges of human existence, including health, energy, food, the 
arts, and the environment. 

Finally, I want to assure all of you that I am working tirelessly to, 
well, work myself out of this job as interim chancellor and provost. The 
presidential search is under way and a search for the next permanent 
chancellor and provost will follow. In the meantime, I will join with the 
vice chancellors and deans to make critical decisions that continue to 
move our university toward a viable and productive future.

Again, thank you for the extraordinary work that you do. It is because of 
your dedication that when people speak of the University of Illinois they 
cite the professionalism and pride of the faculty and staff, which are 
fundamental to our success.

With gratitude,

Campus District.

The Champaign Police Department is investigating a robbery that occurred 
on December 11, 2009 at approximately 4:00 am near the intersection of 
Fifth Street and White Street.  The victim was approached from behind and 
punched in the face.  The unconscious victim was later brought home by 
friends.  When the victim awoke later in the morning, he realized his 
wallet was missing.  This victim could provide no information regarding

The victim believes she was followed by the persons who committed this 
crime from the area of First Street and Springfield Avenue.  The victim 
was pulled into an alley by the offenders and thrown to the ground.  The 
offenders kicked the victim repeatedly in the face and torso.  The 
offenders attempted to remove property from the victim.  The screams 
coming from the victim attracted the attention of a resident of a nearby 
apartment who observed the victim on the ground.  The offenders are 
described as three black males in their early twenties.  One of the 
offenders was tall with a long face.  Another offender was described as 
approximately 5 foot 7 inches tall and slightly overweight with braided 
hair and wearing baggy jeans with chains hanging off of them.  All three 
offenders were wearing loose bomber type jackets.  The victim sustained 
several scratches to her face.

The Urbana Police Department is investigating a robbery that occurred on 
December 13, 2009 at approximately 7:55 p.m. in the 400 block of N. 
Gregory Street.  The victim had delivered pizzas and was returning to his 
vehicle when he was attacked by two or three persons.  The victim was 
struck in the head which knocked him to the ground.  The offenders took 
property from the victim and fled the area running to the east on the 
Clark Street sidewalk towards Lincoln Avenue.  One of the offenders is a 
white male.  The other offender is a black male.  Both offenders were 
described as college-age males wearing blue jeans.  Information on the 
possible third offender was not available.  The victim sustained a 
potential head injury and was transported to a local hospital.

University of Illinois Police responded to a report of a robbery on 
December 13, 2009 at approximately 11:30 p.m.  This incident occurred in 
a ninth floor hallway of Oglesby Hall at Florida Avenue Residence Halls, 
Urbana.  The victim was punched in the face and kneed in the groin area 
by the persons committing this crime.  One offender threatened the victim 
with an implied knife and removed property from the victim.  UIPD 
officers were able to locate two suspects.  One suspect was arrested for 
armed robbery.  The other suspect was arrested for armed robbery and 
intimidation.  UIPD continues to investigate this case and is seeking to 
apprehend the two remaining offenders.  One offender was described as a 
black male being heavy set with long braided hair down to his shoulders 
wearing a baseball cap, blue jeans and white shoes.  The other offender 
was described as a shorter black male wearing a dark-colored hooded 
sweatshirt and white batting-style gloves.

As a result of these crimes, the University of Illinois Police Department 
continues to work with the Champaign and Urbana Police Departments in

Re:	Campus Forums for Presidential Search


The Search Committee to Assist in the Selection of a President will 
conduct a Campus Forum at each campus of the University to receive 
comments and suggestions from members of the University community 
concerning the search for a new president of the University. 

Trustee Pamela B. Strobel, chair of the search committee, stated that 
these are intended to be ""listening sessions"" for the members of the 
search committee that will help the committee develop a set of criteria, 
experiences and qualifications that a new president of the University of 
Illinois should possess. These criteria will then be used to measure the 
qualifications and characteristics of potential candidates. 

The first forum will be held at the Chicago campus on December 2, 2009, 
3:00 - 5:00 p.m. in Rooms A, B, C, first floor of the Student Services 
Building, 1200 West Harrison Street (Racine Avenue and Harrison Streets). 

The second forum will be at the Urbana campus on December 3, 2009, 3:00 - 
5:00 p.m. in the Knight Auditorium, Spurlock Museum, 600 South Gregory 
Street, Urbana (between Illinois and Oregon Streets).

The third forum is scheduled for the Springfield campus on December 8, 
2009, 3:00 - 5:00 p.m., in the auditorium in Brookens Library. 

Individuals wishing to speak to the representatives of the search 
committee will be asked to sign in before the forum begins. Comments may 
also be sent to the search committee at: presidentsearch@uillinois.edu.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Graduate Assistant Tuition Waivers","In the last 24 hours there have been many questions about the University's 
intention regarding tuition waivers.

Let me be as clear as possible in response to this issue. The excellence 
of our graduate programs depends on our capacity to provide fair and 
reasonable expectations for graduate assistants regarding their tuition 
waivers.  

Graduate students with assistantships will not have their tuition waivers 
reduced while they hold qualifying assistantships, are in good academic 
standing, and are making proper progress toward graduation in the program 
in which they began.  

This commitment is consistent with our long-standing and ongoing

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Announcement Regarding GEO","Dear Members of the Campus Community:

The Graduate Employees Organization (GEO) has announced it will strike 
beginning tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m.  

Classes are not cancelled. 

Campus administration will monitor the situation closely and assess 
options for dealing with any disruption that might occur. Our goal is to 
serve our students by minimizing any harm to our educational mission that 
a work stoppage might cause. In most colleges and departments we expect 
classes to proceed uninterrupted.

The university and GEO have been negotiating for seven months on a new 
contract. Saturday night, the two sides agreed on every issue with the 
exception of tuition waivers. Such waivers are tuition exemptions and 
discounts granted to certain graduate students.

Tuition waivers are critical to attracting the best graduate students in a 
nationally competitive market. The university community is committed to 
providing the most competitive tuition waivers possible.

Contrary to GEO assertions, the university has no plans to change current 
policy on tuition waivers. Tuition waivers are governed by the General 
Rules established by the Board of Trustees. The university has assured the 
GEO it will bargain the impact of any change to the fee waiver policy in 
the unlikely event that a change is proposed.

The GEO has announced that it will take the university's contract offer to 
a vote of its members on Tuesday night. We are hopeful that the union 
members will accept the university's offer, which represents the best 
possible package for graduate students within the difficult financial 
constraints we currently face.

The Graduate Employees' Organization has authorized its strike committee 
to call a strike at any time, and a strike is expected Monday, Nov. 16. 
The campus expects that classes will be held as scheduled during the 
strike. It appears that the GEO will establish picket lines around some 
buildings with classrooms, and some instructors have indicated they may 
cancel or relocate classes during a strike.

If you have questions about class access or scheduling, you should contact 
the department that offers the class. Contact information for departments 
is in the campus A-Z Index (http://illinois.edu/ds/azList). 

If you have questions about the impact of a strike on your academic 
progress and degree completion, please raise these questions with your 
college's undergraduate academic affairs office. College contact 
information is also in the A-Z Index.

Students have a right to receive the education for which they are paying 
and for which they have worked hard to earn the opportunity to receive at 
the University of Illinois. Colleges and departments have been planning 
for the possibility of a strike and will ensure that teaching and learning 
continue. The university's goal is to ensure that students are treated

At the Board of Trustees meeting Thursday, the board approved the 
appointment of Robert A. Easter as Interim Provost/Chancellor for the 
Urbana campus effective immediately. He will continue to hold these 
positions until a permanent chancellor and provost are named and have 
assumed their responsibilities, following a national search.

As Interim Provost/Chancellor, Bob will lead the Urbana campus and fulfill 
the duties of chancellor. As interim provost, he serves as the chief 
academic and budgetary officer for the campus and the deans and directors 
of academic units report to him. Bob was named interim provost and 
associate chancellor by the trustees in July. 

Bob has a long history at the University having served as dean of the 
College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences from 2002-09. 
He was head of the animal sciences department from 1996-2001. An award-
winning teacher and researcher, he has been a member of the Urbana faculty 
since 1976. 

He co-authored a book on swine production and has written more than 90 
peer-reviewed articles, 11 book chapters, four monographs and numerous 
papers for conferences and industry publications. In 2006, President 
George W. Bush appointed him to the Board for International Food and 
Agricultural Development (BIFAD), and in 2007 he was appointed as chair of 
BIFAD.

Bob Easter is doing a superb job as provost and I look forward to working 
closely with him and the senior management team in Urbana on the continual 
improvement of the campus.

Bob has my personal thanks for taking on these additional responsibilities.

I write to ask for your help in identifying the people who wrote 
threatening messages in a campus building earlier this month. It appears 
two or more individuals wrote a series of messages to each other on a 
male bathroom stall in Everitt Lab. The messages included anti-Asian and 
anti-Caucasian language. One of the messages in the exchange states that 
the writer plans to kill Asians in Everitt Lab on Nov. 16, leading to a 
response from another individual that he or she would be there to shoot 
the Caucasian individual.

We have been aggressively investigating this case, including conferring 
with the Federal Bureau of Investigations, in attempts to assess the 
credibility of the threat. Although this may stand as only a disturbing 
and anonymous exchange between individuals, we are compelled to inform 
the campus community. If, through investigative efforts, the credibility 
of the threat is believed to have increased, we will share that 
information as well. 

Such vandalism and acts of intolerance are violations of the Student Code 
and the Illinois Criminal Code and could lead to punishment under the 
students discipline system, as well as potential criminal charges.

Our goal always has been, and continues to be, to provide the best 
possible contract within the budget constraints we face.

It is not news that the State of Illinois, and consequently the University 
of Illinois, face severe budget problems and an uncertain financial 
future. As Presidents White and Ikenberry shared recently, immediate 
challenges include the State's lack of capacity to provide the funding for 
this fiscal year that we are to have received but have not received. More 
serious yet is the negative effect that State budget shortfalls will have 
on funding appropriated for the duration of this academic year. Still more 
serious are the projected effects on the University budget for fiscal year 
2011 of the disappearance of federal recovery dollars from our State 
budget and the further erosion of the State's tax base. Financial planning 
is now focused on meeting and coping with financial stresses exceeding any 
the University has encountered for many, many years. Although we have seen 
welcome increases in research funding, and there have been successes in 
the advancement campaign, it must be understood that funds from those 
sources cannot be used for TA salaries.

For these reasons, the GEO's request for a nearly 20% raise in the minimum 
stipend is untenable. As you know, other employees of the University did 
not receive raises this year, and the state's economic situation may yet 
require furloughs and other cost-saving measures before the end of the 
fiscal year.  

The University has been working very hard with the GEO to reach an 
agreement on a new contract, and we have made substantial progress. We 
have held 18 negotiating sessions and have reached tentative agreement on 
several key items.

For example, the University and GEO have agreed to a substantial increase 
in the health insurance fee subsidy provided by the University, increasing 
the University's current contribution of 50% to 75% in years two and three 
of the contract. Additionally, we have agreed on a parental accommodation 
period for the birth or initial placement or adoption of a child.  

We value the contributions graduate students make to the University, and 
we know we are competing nationally and internationally to attract and 
retain the best and brightest students. The total compensation package 
offered by the University, which encompasses wages, waiver of most fees, 
the tuition waiver, and a University of Illinois education, reflects our 
recognition of the value brought to the University by our excellent 
graduate students.

Nearly 60% of GEO members have 50% appointments, which means they are 
required to work part-time, 20 hours a week for nine months each year. The 
average salary for those employees is $16,222 or $20.80 an hour. 

Our commitment to our students and employees has not changed. We remain 
committed to providing a quality education for our students and being a 
fair employer to all employee groups. We continue to seek ways we can 
provide the most beneficial employment to all. But we must not make 
concessions to the extraordinary demands of one group while respecting the 
University's severe budgetary constraints in dealing with all others. 

I remind you again that we have an obligation to our students and their 
families to provide the education which they have sacrificed to attain. 
Only GEO members have a legal right to strike; all other employees have an 
obligation to meet the responsibilities of their positions.  

Employees who choose not to cross a picket line must request and receive 
approval (in advance) for vacation time. As always, vacation approval is 
based on operational need; a unit is not required to approve a vacation 
request if there are operational needs that would be unmet if the request 
is approved. Sick leave cannot be utilized to cover strike-related 
absences. If staff not covered by the GEO contract have unapproved 
absences during the strike, normal discpline procedures will apply. As 
with any union-initiated strike action, GEO members who elect to strike 
rather than meet their job obligations will not be paid for strike 
absences.  

It is important to remember that a work stoppage will do nothing to 
improve the financial situation that constrains what the University can do 
in this round of negotiations, and it will not change what the University 
can offer in these negotiations. The campus remains committed to 
fulfilling our educational mission. Our students are entitled to the 
education they have come to Illinois to receive, many with substantial 
sacrifice by them and their families. We hope assistants will respect 
their instructional obligations and not impair students' progress in their 
current courses. The campus will monitor the situation closely and assess 
options for dealing with any disruption that might occur to minimize the 
harm which a work stoppage would cause.

Instructors are expected to alert students in advance about any changes in 
class assignments or arrangements made because of a strike. The office 
staff in the department or college offering a specific course also will be 
available to respond to questions or problems that might arise in the 
event of a work stoppage, and staff in the Dean of Students office also 
will be available at 217-333-0050 to respond to questions or concerns of 
students or their parents. Some notes on the GEO negotiations are 
available through this link:

From:  President B. Joseph White 
       and Interim President-designate Stanley O. Ikenberry
Re:    University Budget Outlook and Actions


The University of Illinois has been dealing with budget reductions and 
uncertainties for some time. We can't wave these away. Like many other 
public and private research universities around the country, we continue 
to confront them. A deep national recession, a weak Illinois economy and 
serious state financial problems create the challenge. 

During the past decade, the University has been subject to multiple 
rescissions and cuts in our appropriation from the state. In fiscal year 
2002, the University's state general fund appropriation was $804 million. 
By fiscal 2009, that amount was down to $700 million after accounting for 
a $19 million rescission and a redirection of $24 million annually to 
cover part of our health care costs previously paid by the state. This is 
a reduction of 13%, excluding inflation, or 30% in real terms.

The University's net general fund appropriation from the state for the 
current fiscal year is $719 million, including $45 million of federal 
stimulus funds. As of November 2, 2009, the University has billed the 
State for $317 million of the current fiscal year 2010 appropriation. We 
have received very little of that amount. The result is significant cash 
flow problems that we continue to manage. 

Whether the Governor and General Assembly will make downward adjustments 
to our current budget is unknown and may not be known for several months. 
Given this possibility, however, we must take steps now to manage as 
prudently as possible. At the beginning of the year the University put 
funds in reserve centrally in anticipation of difficult budget challenges 
ahead. We must now make further contingency plans to sequester an 
additional 6%, or $45 million, of the fiscal 2010 general fund 
appropriation. 

We have asked Campus and University Administration leaders to develop the 
plans guided by these principles:

  > Safeguard academic and patient-care quality, serve students and 
maintain externally funded research programs. 

  > Identify organizational changes and consolidations that will yield 
longer-term savings.

We do not plan furlough days before the end of the calendar year and we 
hope they can be avoided completely. It will be necessary, however, for 
departments, colleges and administrative units to manage any  hiring on a 
critical needs, by exception basis for the remainder of the 2010 fiscal 
year that ends next June 30. Campus and UA leaders will determine the 
methods for managing personnel costs while reducing overall expenditures. 

Virtually every public university in America faces similar challenges. For 
Illinois, the state economy is expected to remain weak and state revenues 
may decline further. Federal stimulus funds that are an important part of 
the fiscal 2010 budget are not expected to recur in 2011.  

We face difficult choices to position the University for a genuine 
recovery down the road. We intend, for example, to implement a plan to 
reduce administrative costs at the campus and UA levels by a total of $15 
million over the next three years. Other organizational and program 
changes across the University will be analyzed and considered.

We know that living with uncertainty is not easy. Yet it is far from clear 
when state policymakers will craft a plan to address the state's fiscal 
crisis and what the implications of the plan will be for state programs 
and services, including higher education. Securing a stable and high 
quality future for the University of Illinois is our top priority and a 
challenge we all share. We appreciate your understanding, cooperation and 
support during these difficult times.

From: 	Interim Provost Robert Easter

Re:	Admissions Reforms

The Admissions Task Force was charged by former Chancellor Herman, Interim 
Provost Easter, and Senate Executive Committee Chair Tolliver to outline 
how we will implement the recommendations made by the Illinois Admissions 
Review Commission (ARC) in its August 6 report. I am pleased to report 
that the Task Force has completed its work and its recommendations have 
been shared with President White, with the Urbana Council of Deans, and 
with the other two campuses. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to 
the Task Force, particularly its chair, Professor Christine Hurt, for the 
careful and thoughtful work under challenging time constraints. 

The Admissions Task Force was not asked to change the work of the 
admissions staff but to protect it and clarify it - to put, in the words 
of the ARC report, a ""firewall"" around it and insulate it from external 
pressures and undue influence. I write now to share the Task Force's 
recommendations and to summarize the limitations and responsibilities of 
the firewall. 

The Admissions Task Force recommendations state:

With regard to undergraduate admissions, no third party, including 
Trustees, government officials, or university employees without admissions 
responsibilities, shall attempt to communicate with Office of 
Undergraduate Admissions staff members or employees with admissions 
responsibility regarding any applicant file. Any such communication is not 
permitted and would be logged for review by the Senate Admissions 
Committee. Only an applicant, an applicant's parent or legal guardian, 
spouse or secondary high school guidance counselor may communicate with 
the admissions office regarding an individual file.

Third-party communications, typically in the form of letters of 
recommendation, are fundamental to the admissions procedures of most post-
baccalaureate graduate and professional programs. Such communications are 
acceptable so long as the third party is an expert in a relevant academic 
or professional field or has other expertise that bears directly on the 
academic qualifications of an applicant. Other third-party communications 
are prohibited. 

What does this mean for you?

If you are contacted by an applicant or an applicant's parents/legal 
guardian, spouse or high school counselor, you should refer the person to 
the appropriate admissions office or officer.

If you are contacted about an applicant by any other person, you should 
inform the person that you cannot share information about an applicant and 
that unsolicited information from third parties is not considered in the 
admissions process. Moreover, attempting to introduce unsolicited third-
party information into the admissions process is prohibited. Given this 
firewall policy, you should not contact or attempt to pass along third-
party information to an admissions officer or an employee with admissions 
responsibility regarding any particular applicant. 

Admissions officers and employees with admissions responsibility will log 
any third-party influence attempts they receive. The logs will be reviewed 
annually by the Senate Admissions Committee and are subject to public 
scrutiny. Any university employee who violates any part of this policy 
prohibiting improper influence in admissions shall be subject to 
discipline, up to and including termination.

RE:			Goodwin Avenue Closed for Resurfacing

Weather permitting; Goodwin Avenue between Green Street and Gregory Drive 
is scheduled for resurfacing on Thursday, October 29, 2009.  Both 
pedestrian and vehicular traffic will be seriously impacted during this 
work. 

The work will begin at 5:00 a.m. at the intersection of Goodwin Avenue and 
Green Street and will continue all day.  Goodwin Avenue south of Green 
Street and north of Gregory Drive will be closed to traffic the entire 
day. The intersections of Goodwin Avenue and Green Street, Nevada Street 
and  Gregory Drive will remain open during the work; however, delays can 
be expected as work proceeds through these intersections. Oregon Street, 
normally one-way westbound between Mathews and Goodwin, will allow two-way 
traffic while Goodwin Avenue is closed. 

Pedestrian and bicycle traffic will be seriously affected during the 
resurfacing work. Public Works and University staff will be present at the 
intersections along the corridor to direct pedestrians to a safe place to 
cross Goodwin Avenue.  This could result in pedestrians walking a few 
blocks away from their desired crossing location.  We are strongly urging 
pedestrians to obey all traffic control signage and follow all verbal 
directions they are given.  The temperature of freshly laid asphalt can 
range from 250 to 350 degrees.  Any detours in your walking route are for 
your own safety.

C-U MTD routes serving the East Campus between Green Street and Gregory 
Drive will be rerouted.  For more information please go to cumtd.com or 
call 384-8188. 

The ultimate goal of this project is to create a safer corridor for all 
users: pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders, and the motoring public.  
We apologize for any inconvenience that the work is causing, and are 
asking for your continued cooperation as the project nears completion.

In case of inclement weather, this work will be rescheduled and additional 
communication will be issued prior to the work.

 Subject: CRIME-ALERT","I write to inform you of an incident which poses a continuing risk to 
students and employees of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The Champaign Police Department is investigating a report of an armed 
robbery that occurred on 10-25-09 at approximately 3:15 am at the 
intersection of Third Street and White Street.

The victim was walking northbound on the west sidewalk across from the 
intersection of Third Street and White Street when he was approached by a 
male subject.  The male subject stopped in front of the victim and asked 
him if he knew where he could get some bud.  The victim assumed the 
male subject meant cannabis when he asked for bud and told him no and 
continued to walk past the male subject.  As the victim continued to walk 
past the male subject, he felt a hard object pressed against his back.  
The male subject stated, ""Don't turn around, I have a gun.  Give me 
everything you got.""  The victim complied with the male subject's demand 
and provided the male subject $26 in United States currency.  The victim 
did not observe the gun on the male subject, however did describe the 
hard object pressed against his back as circular in shape, like a gun.    

The male suspect was described as an African-American male, approximately 
30 years of age, approximately six feet tall, weighing approximately two 
hundred and fifty pounds with a goatee and a dark complexion.  The male 
suspect was wearing a dark blue hooded sweatshirt, gray sweat pants and a 
white t-shirt under the blue hooded sweatshirt.  The male suspect may 
have also been wearing a black ""skull cap"" on his head under the hood of 
the sweatshirt.

Fortunately, the victim in this incident was not injured.

As a result of this crime, the University of Illinois and Champaign 
Police Departments are increasing patrols in the area and are working 
collaboratively to gather additional suspect information. 

Anyone with information about this incident should call the Champaign 
Police Department at 217-351-4545.  Information also can be shared 
anonymously through Crimestoppers by calling 217-373-TIPS or online at: 
http://www.champaigncountycrimestoppers.com/ 

The University of Illinois Police Department offers the following crime 
prevention strategies:

-Always keep your doors and windows locked.

-Trust your instincts - if you feel uncomfortable about someone near you 
on the street, in an elevator or getting off a bus, go to a populated 
place or yell for help.

-Use well-lit and busy sidewalks if possible. 

-Avoid walking alone or walking near vacant lots, alleys, construction 
sites and wooded areas.

-Learn the locations of emergency phones on campus.

-Carry a cell phone, whistle or a personal alarm to alert people that you 
need help.

-Try to park in an area that will be well-lit and heavily traveled when 
you return.

-Lock your car doors and roll up the windows completely - even if you are 
only running a quick errand.

-Stay alert at all times and call the police immediately to report 
suspicious activity.

-Put the contact ""ICE"" (In Case of Emergency) in your cell phone with a 
name and telephone number of a loved one, to enable emergency services 
personnel to contact your family in the event of an emergency.

-Excessive volume or use of electronic devices (iPods, PDAs, cell phones, 
etc.) distracts you from being alert to potential safety issues.  Unplug 
yourself and tune in to your immediate environment.

-Utilize the SafeWalks program which is designed to provide a walking 
escort to any student between the hours of 9:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. Sunday 
through Thursday and 9:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. Friday and Saturday (call 
333-1216 to arrange a SafeWalk).

-Utilize the Saferides program which is designed to provide a safe 
transport to any student and is generally available during the evening 
hours until 6:30 a.m. (Call 

Finally, if you have not yet done so, please register your contact 
information with Illini-Alert, at emergency.illinois.edu to receive

hardworking faculty and staff; and its smart and idealistic students.

I am proud that many initiatives launched during my time will continue: 
the 100 new faculty excellence professors, the ethnic and multiracial

Never doubt it. Always strive for it. And remember that great aspirations 
must always precede great achievements. The excellence and creativity long 
embedded in our university was always the source of my inspiration.

I thank all of you for helping to make Illinois better. I prepare to step

others to build upon, as I built upon the contributions of those before 
me. It would be disingenuous for me not to acknowledge that my resignation

 Subject: Trustees name interim president","Dear U of I faculty, staff and students,

While many of you likely learned through the media about the actions of 
the Board of Trustees last weekend, I want to communicate to you directly 
about those actions.

The board appointed Stanley O. Ikenberry interim president effective Jan. 
1, 2010. Stan was, of course, the 14th president of the U of I from 1979 
to 1995. One of the University's longest-serving presidents, he brings 
deep knowledge of higher education and relationships with faculty and 
staff from all three campuses, as well as wisdom and energy to the 
position.

Dr. Ikenberry is currently U of I Regent Professor and President Emeritus 
and holds an appointment in the University-wide Institute of Government 
and Public Affairs. 

Stan will act as interim president-designate during the fall semester and 
work with me and other senior administrators to ensure an orderly 
transition. He then will serve as interim president until a permanent 
president is named. The Board's stated objective is to have a new 
president in office by the start of the 2010-11 academic year.

The Board also approved the structure of a 19-member presidential search 
committee to select the next permanent president and engaged an executive 
search firm -- Boston-based Isaacson, Miller -- to consult on the process. 
The composition of the search committee will be three trustees, eight 
faculty members, three students, one member each from the academic 
professional and civil service staffs, one administrative officer, and one 
representative each from the alumni association and foundation.

My resignation as president, tendered September 23 and effective December 
31, was accepted by the Board of Trustees on October 3.

I will be joining the faculty in the College of Business on the Urbana-
Champaign campus.

In my letter of resignation to Board Chairman Christopher Kennedy, I 
said, ""It has been a privilege for my wife, Mary, and me to serve the 
University community. We remain highly committed to the University of 
Illinois, and I look forward to continuing that commitment as a member of 
the faculty."" 

Thank you for your contributions to the quality of the University of 
Illinois.

Sincerely,
B. Joseph White
President

Re: 	Faculty Nominations for Search Committee To Assist in the 
Selection of a President

As you know, the Board of Trustees has accepted the resignation of 
President B. Joseph White and selected a firm to head the search for a new 
permanent President. The search committee will consist of three members of 
the Board of Trustees, eight faculty (likely three from UIUC and UIC and 
two from UIS), three students (one from each campus), one member of the 
civil service staff, one member of the academic professional staff, one 
administrative officer of the University, one representative from the 
Alumni Association, and one representative of the University of Illinois 
Foundation. The Senates of each campus have been asked to nominate twice 
the number of faculty members to be selected and University Senates 
Conference has been asked to draw from these slates in order to recommend 
those who will serve. 

Because the search process has already begun, the Trustees have asked that 
the search committee be constituted as soon as possible. Therefore, the 
Committee on Committees of the UIUC Academic Senate is requesting nominees 
for individuals to serve on this committee. 

Please submit names of nominees by 5:00 p.m. on Friday, October 9 and 
secure confirmation of your nominee's willingness to serve before 
forwarding your nomination.  Nominees who are placed on the final slate 
will be asked to provide a brief biographical statement including faculty 
appointment information (rank and unit affiliation), years of service, 
previous appointments, campus/University service, and previous search 
committee experience.

We encourage nominees from the varied disciplines and who represent the 
diversity on campus. The Committee on Committees will present a slate of 
candidates to the Senate for final selection. An online Senate election 
for these positions will be conducted between October 14 and 16. The final 
campus slate will then be forwarded to the University Senates Conference.

The Urbana Police Department is investigating a report of an armed 
robbery that occurred on 09-14-09 at approximately 7:30 pm at 708 South 
Goodwin Avenue.

The victim was working at the Family Pride Convenience Store when she was 
approached by a male subject who demanded money.  The subject displayed a 
weapon, described as a ""box cutter,"" and retrieved money from the cash 
register.  The victim complied and the suspect fled on foot from the 
scene.

The suspect was described as an African-American male, early 40's, 
approximately 6'00"" to 6'03"" tall with a thin build.  The suspect was 
described as having grey/black hair and a similar colored beard.  The 
suspect was also reported to be wearing a white shirt and a white hat at 
the time of the incident.

Fortunately, the victim in this incident was not injured.

As a result of this crime, the University of Illinois and Urbana Police 
Departments are increasing patrols in the area and are working 
collaboratively to gather additional suspect information. 

Anyone with information about this incident should call the Urbana Police 
Department at 217-384-2320.  Information also can be shared anonymously 
through Crimestoppers by calling 217-373-TIPS or online at: 
http://www.champaigncountycrimestoppers.com/ 

The University of Illinois Police Department offers the following crime 
prevention strategies:

-Always keep your doors and windows locked.

-Trust your instincts - if you feel uncomfortable about someone near you 
on the street, in an elevator or getting off a bus, go to a populated 
place or yell for help.

-Use well-lit and busy sidewalks if possible. 

-Avoid walking alone or walking near vacant lots, alleys, construction 
sites and wooded areas.

-Learn the locations of emergency phones on campus.

-Carry a cell phone, whistle or a personal alarm to alert people that you 
need help.

-Try to park in an area that will be well-lit and heavily traveled when 
you return.

-Lock your car doors and roll up the windows completely - even if you are 
only running a quick errand.

-Stay alert at all times and call the police immediately to report 
suspicious activity.

-Put the contact ""ICE"" (In Case of Emergency) in your cell phone with a 
name and telephone number of a loved one, to enable emergency services 
personnel to contact your family in the event of an emergency.

-Excessive volume or use of electronic devices (iPods, PDAs, cell phones, 
etc.) distracts you from being alert to potential safety issues.  Unplug 
yourself and tune in to your immediate environment.

-Utilize the SafeWalks program which is designed to provide a walking 
escort to any student between the hours of 9:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. Sunday 
through Thursday and 9:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. Friday and Saturday (call

The University of Illinois and Oak Lawn Police Departments are 
investigating a report of a sexual assault that occurred near Fourth 
Street and Peabody Drive at approximately 12:45 am on September 13th, 
2009. 

On September 13th, 2009, between 12:30 am and 1:00 am, an 18 year old 
female was walking in the area of Fourth Street and Peabody Drive in 
Champaign when she was grabbed by an unknown male and pulled into some 
nearby bushes and sexually assaulted.  The suspect fled the scene when 
other people approached the area.  The victim, who is not a University of 
Illinois student, sought medical attention at an Oak Lawn, Illinois 
hospital.  The victim was unable to provide a description of the suspect.

The University of Illinois Police Department is increasing patrols as a 
result of this incident and is working with the Oak Lawn Police 
Department to identify the suspect.

Police encourage the campus community to report suspicious behavior and 
take actions to remove the opportunity for a crime to occur. The 
following tips are provided to increase your safety.
 
-Do not allow the opportunity for a crime to occur - avoid placing 
yourself in environments where criminals will have the opportunity to 
commit a personal crime.

-Always keep your doors and windows locked.

- If possible, let a friend or roommate know where and with whom you will 
be and when you will be back when you go out.

 -Trust your instincts - if you feel uncomfortable about someone near you 
on the street, in an elevator or getting off a bus, go to a populated

- Use well-lit and busy sidewalks. 

 -Avoid walking alone or walking near vacant lots, alleys, construction

 -Carry a cell phone, whistle or a personal alarm to alert people that 
you need help.

 -Try to park in an area that will be well-lit and heavily traveled when 
you return.

 -If you choose to consume alcohol, drink responsibly - remember your 
ability to respond is diminished by over-consumption of alcohol.

 -Stay alert at all times and call the police immediately to report 
suspicious activity. 

 -Put the contact ""ICE"" (In Case of Emergency) in your cell phone with a 
name and telephone number of a loved one, to enable emergency services 
personnel to contact your family in the event of an emergency.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Update on Novel H1N1 Influenza","Dear Members of the Campus Community:

I write to offer an update on the Novel H1N1 Influenza affecting our 
campus. To date, we have reported more than 250 suspected cases of Novel 
H1N1 flu - sometimes called swine flu - at the Urbana campus, and we 
expect that number to increase in the coming weeks. So far, many cases 
have been relatively mild, with fever, cough, sore throat, and body aches 
being the primary symptoms.

To reduce your risk of catching even a mild case of the flu, please 
remember to wash your hands frequently, cover your mouth and nose when you 
cough or sneeze and avoid sharing eating utensils, glasses and other 
items. If you get the flu, isolate yourself until you have been free of 
fever without the aid of fever-reducing medicine for at least 24 hours. If 
you are a student, consider contacting your parents and arrange to 
recuperate at your permanent home.

Come to McKinley if you have suspected influenza and also have an 
underlying illness, such as diabetes, sickle-cell anemia, or asthma, or if 
you are pregnant. If you feel that you've started to recover from 
influenza and your fever returns, you also should seek medical attention. 
Most other students with influenza will be able to manage without medical 
assistance. We will document your illness if you call the 24/7 Dial-a-
Nurse (217-333-2700) or visit McKinley. 

Other members of the campus community who experience flu-like symptoms 
should contact their family physician.

In efforts to prevent the spread of either Novel H1N1 and of seasonal flu, 
I recommend that you consider getting vaccinated for both types of flu 
this fall. The shot for seasonal flu will be available soon at McKinley or 
from your personal physician. Check the McKinley Web site for more 
information about availability of the flu vaccine. A Novel H1N1 vaccine is 
expected to be ready in late October or November, and McKinley plans to 
offer it to students, faculty, and staff in accordance with priorities 
established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Campus Reaccreditation","Dear Campus Community,

I write to you today to inform you of an upcoming reaccreditation visit to 
campus by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central 
Association.  Accreditation is a voluntary process of critical self-
analysis and internal and external review that Illinois undergoes every 10 
years.  We have been accredited by the Commission since 1913.  
Institutional accreditation evaluates an entire institution and accredits 
it as a whole.

A review team will visit our campus from October 11-14, 2009.  As members 
of our campus community, you will have an opportunity to participate in 
this process at one of several open forums that will be publicized as the 
review dates approach.  In anticipation of this review, we have produced a 
self-study that focuses on the strengths of our outstanding campus and 
identifies opportunities for growth in the future.  The self-study was 
recently finalized and will be distributed to deans, directors, and other 
senior campus leaders in the days to come.

We have also created a website (http://www.reaccreditation.illinois.edu/) 
as a resource for the review team as well as for our campus.  The website 
contains several links and supporting documents referred to in the self-
study and also contains a viewable version of the self-study.  We look 
forward to this visit and encourage you to become an active part of the 
process.

Very truly yours,

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Admissions","Dear Campus Community:

Following a meeting late yesterday afternoon with members of the Senate 
Executive Committee, the provost, and other campus leaders, I am writing 
to inform you that we are initiating a multi-pronged approach to 
admissions reforms on the Urbana campus.

These efforts at Urbana respond to and complement the broader system-wide 
effort begun by President White last week, when he directed the Urbana, 
Chicago and Springfield campuses to develop by September 23 a framework 
that outlines how we will implement the recommendations made by the 
Illinois Admissions Review Commission (ARC) in its August 6 report.

Among our new measures on the Urbana campus are the following: 

- Interim Provost Robert Easter, Senate Executive Committee (SEC) 
Chair Joyce Tolliver, and I have appointed an Admissions Task Force and 
charged that group to produce proposals concerning how appeals, third-
party inquiries and related components of the admissions process will be 
handled at Illinois.  Members of the Task Force and our charge to them 
are identified below.*
- A web-based appeals process for admissions will go online this 
fall.  Planning for this began in the fall of 2008 and the fall 2009 
rollout will enable an electronic appeals process that is both easy and 
accessible to all individuals applying for academic year 2010-11.
- As the Task Force work unfolds, we will be seeking the advice of 
experts in higher education who have volunteered to add their larger 
input concerning the guidelines and practices we will consider, to set 
our outcomes in a national perspective.  Members of this distinguished 
panel, who are being appointed by Interim Provost Easter, SEC Chair 
Tolliver and me are:

o William B. DeLauder - President of Delaware State University, 
1987-2003; Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at North Carolina A&T 
State University, 1981-1987; Executive Director to the Commission on the 
Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program
o Shirley Strum Kenny - President of Stony Brook University, 1994-
2009 [Stony Brook is one of only two ""flagship"" institutions of the 64-
school State University of New York system]; chairman of the landmark 
Boyer Commission on Educating Undergraduates in the Research University
o Richard D. Legon - President of the Association of Governing 
Boards of Universities and Colleges, 2006-  ; with the Association since 
1983 and previously served as its Executive Vice President
o M. Peter McPherson - President of the Association of Public and 
Land-grant Universities (acting as a private citizen); President of 
Michigan State University, 1993-2004 [Richard Herman is a Board member of 
APLU]
o Gary F. Smith - Director (Emeritus) of Admissions and Registrar 
of University of Missouri-Columbia, 1971-2000
o John D. Wiley - Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-
Madison, 2001-2008; Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs at 
University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1994-2000

Since May when significant media coverage began to focus on the ""Category 
I"" admissions practice at Illinois, we have stressed that we have an 
exceptional group of admissions officers on campus. The integrity and the 
validity of decisions made by this group have not been brought into 
question by the intensive review conducted by the ARC or by the extensive 
media coverage of ""clout"" in admissions. The decisions of our admissions 
team are guided by sound principles, they are produced through a 
scrupulously fair process, and they reflect the integrity of an excellent 
professional staff.

The Admissions Task Force is not asked to change the work of the 
admissions staff but to protect it and clarify it - to put, in the words 
of the ARC report, a ""fire-wall"" around it and insulate it from external 
pressures and undue influence from administrators.  Those factors have 
been removed.

Moving forward, I plan to take responsibility for ensuring admissions 
reforms here at the Urbana campus.  I will work with our great admissions 
staff to create a process that is a model for the nation.  This will be a 
seminal best practices approach that is equitable and transparent and 
befits the academic reputation of one of the finest universities in the 
world.  Illinois deserves no less.

Very truly yours,

Richard Herman
Chancellor

- Produce a statement that clearly describes our admissions 
criteria, and the decision-making process they inform, that will be 
publicly accessible on the admissions website.

- Identify the key components necessary to institute an admissions 
appeals process and report on progress toward the development of that 
process.

- Identify the components necessary to construct a University-wide 
Code of Conduct regarding admissions, a code by 
which ""sponsors,""  ""University leadership,"" and all other parties will be 
expected to abide.

- Establish a process for dealing with third-party inquiries. This 
process should cover three key areas: how to respond to third-party 
inquiries; how best to record third-party inquiries in a log that will be 
a public document; how to ensure that admissions decisions are not 
influenced by third-party inquiries. 

- Produce a statement that recognizes the importance of diversity 
in the admissions process and that helps ensure diversity among 
admissions officers.

- Recommend provisions for a one-year intensive review of actions 
taken as a result of the previous recommendations.

Subject:	Campus Crime Alert

I write to inform you of an incident which poses a continuing risk to 
students and employees of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The Champaign Police and Fire Departments are investigating multiple 
reports of arson that occurred on August 16, 2009.  A series of fires 
were reported between 5:09 am and 5:32 am.  The first fire was reported 
at 202 E. Green with subsequent reports occurring at 108 East Green, 300 
East Healey, 400 East Healey, and 503 East Stoughton.  

The incidents were reported by a University of Illinois Police Officer, a 
Champaign Police Officer and a citizen who observed the fires at the 
aforementioned locations. The incidents located at 202 East Green and 108 
East Green were brush fires where the brush had been piled next to the 
buildings.  The incidents at 300 East Healey and 400 East Healey were 
dumpster fires.  The incident at 503 E. Stoughton was a roof fire.  All 
fires reported occurred between 5:09 am and 5:32 am on August 16th, 
2009.  Fortunately, there were no reported injuries as a result of these 
fires.  At this time, there is no suspect information. 

The University of Illinois and Champaign Police Departments are 
increasing patrols as a result of this incident to identify and arrest 
the suspect(s). 

Anyone with information about this incident should call the Champaign 
Police Department at 217-351-4545.  Information also can be shared 
anonymously through Crimestoppers by calling 217-373-TIPS or online at: 
http://www.champaigncountycrimestoppers.com/ 

Police encourage the campus community to report suspicious behavior and 
take actions to remove the opportunity for a crime to occur. The 
following tips are provided to increase your safety.
 
-Do not allow the opportunity for a crime to occur - avoid placing 
yourself in environments where criminals will have the opportunity to 
commit a personal crime.

 -Learn the locations of emergency phones on campus.

 -Carry a cell phone, whistle or a personal alarm to alert people that 
you need help.

 -Stay alert at all times and call the police immediately to report 
suspicious activity.

 -Put ICE (In Case of Emergency) in your cell phone, along with a name 
and telephone number of a loved one, to enable emergency services 
personnel to contact your family in the event of an emergency.

 -Excessive volume or use of electronic devices (iPods, PDAs, cell 
phones, etc.) distracts you from being alert to potential safety issues. 
Unplug yourself and tune in to your immediate environment.

 Finally, if you have not yet done so, please register your contact 
information with Illini-Alert, at emergency.illinois.edu to receive 
messages about critical safety issues on campus.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Flu Preparedness","Most medical authorities predict we are likely to face a very difficult 
flu season.

Novel H1N1 Influenza A, sometimes called swine flu, is expected to affect 
schools and universities nationwide as soon as early fall. This virus 
tends to infect young people more easily and severely than people born 
before 1957.

The vaccine for seasonal flu, the common flu that occurs annually and 
typically peaks in February in Illinois, does not protect against H1N1 
flu. Most experts agree, however, that vaccination with the seasonal flu 
vaccine early in the fall will help reduce the chance of having a flu-like 
illness confused with the more serious H1N1 flu. The Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) plans to encourage medical facilities to 
offer access to this year?s seasonal flu vaccine as early as next month. 

A vaccine for the novel H1N1 Influenza A is under development and probably 
will arrive in limited quantities in mid- to late fall. In the meantime, 
it is prudent to take reasonable measures to reduce the chance of exposure 
and spread of H1N1 influenza.

It is important to develop basic good habits. It is most important that 
people cover their cough to reduce spread of the virus to others. People 
should carry and use disposable hand tissues, wash their hands frequently, 
or, alternatively, use an alcohol-based sanitizer. The CDC (www.cdc.gov) 
has helpful Web sites that include videos and detailed information about 
these and other measures for flu preparedness.

Those who have an influenza-like illness, with symptoms such as cough, 
fever and sore throat, should stay out of close contact with others and 
not come to work or class to reduce the spread of infection. Typically, 
infection with these viruses can cause a person to be ill for a week.

Everyone should have a plan in the event they become ill. The overwhelming 
majority of people will do fairly well after a week of staying home and 
utilizing common, practical home-care measures. For this reason, ill 
students should plan to either go home to their family for about a week, 
or spend a week in relative isolation in a room to avoid infecting others. 
During this time, they will need ready access to thermometers, hydrating 
liquids, easily prepared foods, a fever medication, hand sanitizer and 
facial tissues. Students would be wise to come to campus with these items. 

It is quite possible health-care facilities may advocate home care for 
many of the less sick. Therefore, it is important people check Web sites 
such as the McKinley site (www.mckinley.illinois.edu/), which links to the 
CDC site, to stay up to date.

It is particularly important that faculty assist in helping to reduce 
exposure on campus, such as developing reasonable absence requirements, 
considering alternative distance-learning options, promoting good habits 
in the classroom and most important, encouraging people who are sick to 
stay home. Likewise, university staff should consider how to plan for a 
possible difficult flu season.

Finally, it is important that we all try to help one another and be on the 

look out for individuals who might need food deliveries, assistance with 
note taking, and other measures. Planning and simple common-sense measures 
will go a long way to protect the health of our community.

 Subject: Interim Furlough Policy","Dear Colleagues:

We write to inform you of our plans should the University encounter budget 
shortfalls during the 2010 fiscal year that began July 1. We have been 
working hard to keep people employed during this very difficult economic 
period. We hope there will not be shortfalls. But we must be prepared in 
light of the financial challenges facing the state.

Most of the University's costs -- more than 70 percent -- are for people. 
Should we experience a significant budget shortfall, we must be ready to 
reduce personnel costs in ways that are shared and fair while minimizing 
disruptions to our work and the people we serve.

We have examined carefully the best ways to manage fairly a budget 
shortfall, should one develop, when it comes to personnel. There are 
several categories of employment at the University including people 
represented by unions, Civil Service members, faculty, and academic 
professionals. As a result, no single action to reduce costs in the case 
of a budget shortfall is right for all employee groups.

Therefore, we plan to take the following approach, should we need to 
reduce personnel costs.

Civil Service members will continue to be covered by layoff provisions of 
the Civil Service System. For union-represented employees, we will, of 
course, follow contract and statutory obligations. 

With regard to faculty and academic professionals, we are putting in place 
an interim policy to enable the University to declare unpaid furlough 
days, if needed, to cope with budget shortfalls. The policy and related 
information are found at:



Reflecting the interim policy, the Notifications of Appointment (NOAs) 
that will be issued effective August 16, 2009 (new and renewal), and all 
NOAs issued after that date, will include a provision allowing for unpaid 
furlough days for faculty and academic professionals. The revised NOA form 
will also include language shortening the appointment period for grants 
and contracts-funded positions in the event of a loss of such funds.

In line with our commitment to shared governance, we will consult with 
representatives of faculty and academic professionals should the need to 
declare furlough days arise. We will also confer with them as we consider 
making permanent the interim policy. 

We reiterate that we are not, at this time, declaring furlough days for 
fiscal 2010. We hope that they, and other actions to reduce personnel 
costs, will not be needed. But we must be prepared. 

Thank you for your membership in the University of Illinois community. 
Thank you also for your work at the University and on behalf of our 
students and all who depend on us.

 Subject: State Capital Budget Enacted ","On July 13th, Governor Pat Quinn signed a major capital appropriation bill 
for the State of Illinois into law. It represents the first major, 
publicly funded capital initiative in the state in nearly a decade, and it 
is very welcome news for the University of Illinois' three campuses. 

Appropriations for projects the capital bill includes for the University 
of Illinois are the following:

-- University-wide, $32.2 million for repair-and-renovation of facilities 
on all three campuses.
-- Urbana, $57.3 million to renovate Lincoln Hall.
-- Urbana, $20 million to construct a Post Harvest Crop Processing and 
Research Laboratory.
-- Urbana, $44.5 million to construct an Electrical and Computer 
Engineering Building.
-- Urbana, $60 million for the Petascale supercomputing facility is 
included in the state Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity 
(DCEO) budget.
-- Chicago, $20.8 million to upgrade campus infrastructure and College of 
Dentistry modernization.
-- Chicago, $14.8 million to construct a National Rural Health Center at 
the UIC College of Medicine campus in Rockford.
-- Springfield, $4 million for renovation and construction of the Public 
Safety Building.
-- Chicago, a $1.3 million DCEO grant for construction of a College of 
Medicine (COM) cancer research facility in Peoria, and a $500,000 DCEO 
grant to the Heartland Foundation for costs associated with the 
construction of the cancer research center at the COM in Peoria. 
-- Chicago, a $175,000 DCEO grant to the UIC College of Dentistry for a 
pediatric dental clinic.

While the capital appropriation bills have been signed, there are 
additional steps in the process. A bonding authorization has been signed 
but must be implemented, as well as the mechanism for debt service. The 
release of the projects through the Governor's office must be authorized 
and the contractual processes through the Illinois Capital Development 
Board and the University's Board of Trustees will require action. 

However, I believe there is a strong desire by the Governor and the 
General Assembly to move forward on these projects, and I am optimistic 
that the process will continue with urgency.

There are some additional sources of funding that the University may be 
able to access with other state agencies. We will continue to pursue 
funding through the competitive processes.

I thank all those involved in the process to make this 2010 capital bill a 
reality. These are very high priority projects for the University, and I 
thank the Governor and the General Assembly for this breakthrough in 
capital funding.

Richard Herman recognized in his testimony before the Commission, problems 
exist with the University's current admissions practices that must be 
corrected. The University will continue to fully cooperate with the 
Commission to enable ARC members to fulfill their mission as chartered by 
Governor Pat Quinn. In recent weeks, the University has provided the 
Commission and the media with more than 5,000 pages of relevant documents 
in response to Freedom of Information Act and other requests. Witnesses 
have come forward, as requested by the Commission, for interviews with the 
ARC's staff and for formal testimony before the Commission. 

Our goal as a University is to fully air the problems with our current 
admissions practices so that we can take corrective action and ensure 
public confidence in our admissions process going forward. As the ARC 
continues its work, the Board of Trustees and administration of the 
University continue our own examination of our admissions practices as 
well as those at peer institutions for the purpose of identifying best 
practices and ideas for improvement. We will share them with the 
Commission for its consideration.

We are committed to having a fair and transparent admissions process that 
is free from inappropriate interference and pressures. Our admissions 
process must enable us to compete successfully with peer institutions in 
attracting students who will compose outstanding classes for our colleges 
and schools. That is my commitment as president of the University and it 
is the mandate of the Board of Trustees.

I look forward to testifying before the Commission in the days ahead. I am 
grateful to Judge Mikva and members of the ARC for serving the state in 
this important capacity.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Letter to Faculty and Staff","Dear Campus Community:

In just eight short weeks more than 41,000 students will return to the 
Urbana-Champaign campus. Indeed, during summer orientation we've watched 
many of the incoming class as they and their families eagerly explore the 
campus. Our students come here because we are the preeminent institution 
of public higher education in Illinois today as we have been for the past 
142 years. Young women and men come here to receive a first-rate education 
that will enable them to be the next generation of leaders. People of 
Illinois rely on us to fulfill this weighty responsibility and we must be 
prepared to do so. With that in mind, it is important that we focus our 
energies in preparation for the first day of classes on August 24, just as 
our students and their families will.

The University and its admissions process has been the subject of intense 
scrutiny and media coverage. Many legitimate questions are being asked 
about a long-existing admissions process. I and others are intending to 
cooperate fully with Gov. Pat Quinn's Admissions Review Commission and 
implement expeditiously all appropriate measures to improve our admissions 
process. Yet, because the University is and always has been larger than 
any individuals, I have all the confidence it will get through this moment 
and emerge stronger than ever. 

I ask you to continue to do the great job that you have always done in 
making Illinois one of the very best public, land grant universities in 
the country. We must continue to conduct campus business. The future of 
Illinois' sons and daughters depends on it. 

Thank you,

Re:     Admissions Review Commission

Today, Governor Pat Quinn announced the formation of an Admissions Review 
Commission, an independent, fact-finding group that the governor has named 
to investigate claims of special treatment for some applicants to the 
University of Illinois.

On behalf of our University community, I thank the Governor for this 
initiative and express our appreciation to retired federal Judge Abner 
Mikva, who will chair the Commission, and all those who have agreed to 
serve. 

I am mandating complete and full cooperation with the Commission from 
every member of the University community. The Commission will have access 
to everybody and everything it needs to conduct its work. Any request or 
directive from the Commission is to be treated as the highest priority and 
responses are to be timely. 

I have instructed University Counsel Thomas R. Bearrows to manage the 
University's working relationship with the Commission. Please respond to 
any requests from the Commission through Mr. Bearrows. 

With regard to the previously announced University task force on 
admissions, we will not pursue this initiative at this time in order to 
focus on cooperation with the independent Commission. However, each 
campus, academic unit and admissions office should prepare for the 
upcoming admissions cycle for the 2010-2011 academic year with a renewed 
focus on the vital importance of objectivity and fairness in the 
admissions process.

When the Commission has completed and reported its work, we will come 
together as a University community to ensure that our admissions practices 
are exemplary.

I again thank Governor Quinn and Judge Mikva and his colleagues for this 
important service to the University of Illinois.

students and employees of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The University of Illinois Police Department is investigating a report of 
an armed robbery that occurred on 06-06-09 at about 12:30 am near the 
intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue and Dorner Drive.

The victim was walking westbound on Pennsylvania Avenue when he was 
approached from behind by a single subject.  The victim turned around and 
observed a white male subject who appeared to have a gun in his hand.  
The suspect demanded cash from the victim.  The victim complied and the 
suspect fled on foot from the scene.

The suspect was described as a white male, early 20's, approximately 
6'00"" to 6'04"" tall, athletically built and clean shaven.  The suspect 
was wearing a dark grey athletic sweatsuit with the hood pulled over his 
head.

Fortunately, the victim in this incident was not injured.

Please note the Urbana Police Department is currently investigating a 
similar incident which occurred on the same date and within the same time 
period.  The physical description of the suspect in the Urbana case is 
very similar to the suspect in the University incident.

As a result of this crime, the University of Illinois Police Department 
will be increasing patrols in the area and is working collaboratively 
with the Urbana Police Department to gather additional suspect 
information. 

Anyone with information about this incident should call the University of

The University of Illinois Police Department offers the following crime 
prevention strategies:

-Always keep your doors and windows locked.

-Trust your instincts - if you feel uncomfortable about someone near you 
on the street, in an elevator or getting off a bus, go to a populated 
place or yell for help.

-Use well-lit and busy sidewalks if possible. 

-Avoid walking alone or walking near vacant lots, alleys, construction 
sites and wooded areas.

-Learn the locations of emergency phones on campus.

-Carry a cell phone, whistle or a personal alarm to alert people that you 
need help.

-Try to park in an area that will be well-lit and heavily traveled when 
you return.

-Lock your car doors and roll up the windows completely - even if you are 
only running a quick errand.

-Stay alert at all times and call the police immediately to report 
suspicious activity.

-Put ICE (In Case of Emergency) in your cell phone, along with a name and 
telephone number of a loved one, to enable emergency services personnel 
to contact your family in the event of an emergency.

-Excessive volume or use of electronic devices (iPods, PDAs, cell phones,

Illinois 2010 fiscal year (July 1, 2009-June 30, 2010), and it restores 
the 2.5 percent budget rescission in fiscal 2009. 

  In addition, the U of I will receive $53.3 million in U.S. Department 
of Education funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 
2009, the federal economic stimulus bill. The total fiscal 2010 state 
general revenue funding is $751.2 million. This appropriation reflects a 
1.1 percent increase, $7.8 million, in the university's base operating 
funds from the state over fiscal 2009 funding. These funds are contingent 
upon Gov. Patrick Quinn's signature of approval.

  The Legislature also has acted on a capital budget that allocates 
$249.5 million to the U of I for fiscal 2010. 

  - The Urbana campus would receive capital funds for the Lincoln Hall 
renovation, a post-harvest crop processing and research laboratory, the 
National Center for Supercomputing Applications' petascale computing 
facility and an electrical and computer engineering building.

  - The Chicago campus would receive capital funds to modernize its 
College of Dentistry building and to construct the National Rural Health 
Center at the College of Medicine at Rockford. The College of Medicine 
would also receive capital funds to construct a cancer-research center in 
Peoria. The College of Dentistry would receive funding to build a 
pediatric dental clinic.

  - The Springfield campus would receive capital funds for a public-
safety building.

  The three campuses would receive repair and renovation funds to address 
deferred maintenance in the amounts of $18.6 million for the Urbana 
campus, $12.5 million for the Chicago campus and $1 million for the 
Springfield campus. Capital funding is contingent upon final legislative 
approval and Gov. Quinn's signature of approval.

  Other U of I funding in fiscal 2010 statewide legislative budget bills 
include allocations for Cooperative Extension, the Division of 
Specialized Care for Children and sickle-cell research. (Project Chance 
funding continues with support from the University's general revenue 
funds.)

  We at the U of I appreciate the foresight of the state's legislators 
and governor for recognizing even in these difficult economic times that 
higher education funding remains an important state priority and an 
investment in the future.

  At its May meeting in Chicago, the Board of Trustees approved a 
preliminary 2010 fiscal-year university budget of $4.5 billion. Student 
room-and-board rates and fees were set at the trustees' January meeting. 

  Tuition for first-time, 2009-10 incoming students will be set soon by 
the Board of Trustees. Tuition for returning undergraduate students will 
be the same as last year under the four-year tuition guarantee.

  The University of Illinois president and the chancellors of the 
university's three campuses said Monday that they will create a task 
force to review aspects of the university's admissions process through 
which many constituents inquire about and advocate for applicants for 
admission.

  The review will examine how contacts from legislators, trustees, alumni 
and others have been managed in the past, what best practices are at peer 
institutions and what changes should be made going forward to ensure the 
integrity of the admissions process. 

  The task force will be comprised of university personnel, including one 
or more faculty representatives, and external members who will bring 
expertise and perspective to the review. The task force's work will be 
reviewed by the Board of Trustees as the process unfolds. The make-up of 
the panel and a timetable for its work will be announced shortly. The 
university's campuses in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield 
recently wrapped up the admissions cycle for their fall incoming classes, 
and the next major admissions cycle begins in September.

  The university also announced it has suspended use of the so-
called ""Category I"" list until the review is completed and 
recommendations on new practices are considered. The list consisted of 
the names of about 160 Urbana campus applicants on behalf of whom 
admissions inquiries were made by public officials, alumni and others. 
With 26,000 applicants for 7,000 seats in the 2009 incoming class, the 
university received thousands of contacts in the past year about 
admissions cases.

I am writing you to respond to today's story in the Chicago Tribune 
regarding admissions policies at Illinois. 

Let me state at the outset that I have full confidence in our Office of 
Undergraduate Admissions and its professional and dedicated staff led by 
Associate Provost Keith Marshall and Director Stacey Kostell. The 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has an admissions process based 
on integrity and fairness, one that produces an incoming class that ranks 
among the best academically in the nation. Our graduates go on to do great 
work in the world and, in turn, they reward us through their support and 
loyalty as Illinois alumni.  

It is no secret that competition for admission at Illinois is stiff. 
Thousands of people contact University administrators and others with ties 
to the university every year in regard to the admissions process - 2,300 
calls alone are received by the admissions office on the first decision 
day. This year, the university received 26,000 applications for only about 
7,000 seats in the incoming class. For the Class of 2013, the average ACT 
score was 28 and the average high school class rank was in the 88th 
percentile. We are proud of this tradition of academic quality.

As a land grant university we remain committed to be inclusive and 
accessible in our pursuit of academic excellence. We seek to represent as 
closely as we can the full demographic of the state. With that in mind, we 
will continue to look at academic qualifications and other pertinent 
information included in each application while asking whether we believe 
the student will succeed at our university. 

Admissions is not a science. However, we welcome the challenge the Tribune 
story presents to make every possible effort to ensure the integrity our 
admissions process. 

But given our high retention rate and the many successes of our graduates, 
we believe we mostly get it right.

To:      Members of the University of Illinois Community
 
From:    B. Joseph White
 
Re:      Admissions
 
  There is a story in the Chicago Tribune today about the admissions 
process at the Urbana-Champaign campus of the University of Illinois.  I 
have several observations about this process and the Tribune story that I 
want to share with you.
 
  First and most important, all admissions to the University of Illinois 
should be based on merit. There will be many inquiries and expressions of 
support and interest for applicants, including from powerful people, but 
it is our job to manage a merit-based system and not succumb to 
pressure.  
 
  Second, it is the case that we track inquiries and expressions of 
interest in particular applicants by key alumni, political officials, 
trustees and others--as does every highly selective institution.  This 
was the case at the University of Michigan, where I spent 25 years, and 
at Georgetown University, where I served on the board of directors.  This 
is good admissions management and a necessary courtesy to these 
individuals.  Tracking these admissions cases does not and should not 
translate into inappropriate pressure for admission, nor should it infer 
that any pressure would be tolerated.  
 
  Third, the Tribune makes no assertion that unqualified individuals were 
admitted to the University.  This must always be the case.  In addition, 
if we have had a problem with inappropriate pressures for admission from 
well-connected people, numbers from the Tribune article suggest it is a 
small one which does not corrupt the admissions system and which we can 
quickly correct.  Specifically, there were about 26,000 applications to 
the Urbana campus this year.  About 18,000 applicants were admitted using 
the 69% admissions rate cited in the article.  The 160 ""I list"" 
applicants had a 77% admissions rate, according to the Tribune. This 
translates into the admission of 13 more applicants on the Category I 
list admissions rate versus the standard rate.  
 
  The University of Illinois depends on the trust of the people of 
Illinois.  I think that trust is deserved.  To the extent we have had 
instances of admissions officers or others experiencing and succumbing to 
inappropriate pressure for admission of less qualified over more 
qualified candidates, this is a problem that we can and will correct.

Date: 	May 18, 2009

Effective Fall 2009, students need to be aware of a change to the campus 
definition of ""directory"" information. This change will be made to better 
serve students and to make business processes and academic support 
processes less cumbersome and more efficient. 

Other specifics include:
-- The list of items defined as ""directory"" information will be expanded 
to include the University Identification Number (UIN). 
-- This change is made in accordance with the Family Educational Rights 
and Privacy Act (FERPA). 
-- Beginning September 1, 2009, the revised policy will be incorporated in 
the Student Code and in other policies that refer to FERPA. For your 
reference the current Student Code is found at the following web site: 
 
-- As in the past, campus units may disclose student directory information 
so long as those students who choose FERPA suppression are omitted. 
-- Students should expect small changes in the way staff verifies student 
identity. Staff will no longer rely solely on the UIN---additional 
verification must be used.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Congratulations Class of 2009","Dear Campus Community: 

As we approach the 138th Commencement in Illinois' history this seems an
excellent opportunity to reflect on where this great university is at this
moment. 

First, let us pause momentarily from the ongoing Sturm und Drang of the
global and domestic recession and celebrate Commencement. Consider this
instead: On May 17, thousands of young women and men that we have inspired,
provoked, and taught, will receive their college diplomas. We are confident
that they will go on to accomplish great things and have productive,
successful lives that will contribute to solving the great challenges of
our times. 

We are a public, research university and, as such, students get to
experience the special nature of that noble mission here at Illinois. This
is what we do so well. This is why we work so hard. And this remains our
greatest gift to society.

Commencement is Illinois unplugged! The occasion is this institution at its
roots, without the usual politics and posturing. This is a time when we can
say without adornment that we have fulfilled that great promise of the
Morrill Act of 1862 to educate this state's bright and motivated young
people and that we have ignited their curiosity and passions, and channeled
their boundless idealism for the betterment of the world. 

I believe this moment is always worth celebrating as if it were the very
first Commencement in our long and rich history. Commencement also allows
us an opportunity to recommit once again to an even better future for
Illinois. 

There are so many wonderful snapshots when I look back on this academic
year and sift through the countless meetings and speeches, the casual talks
with faculty, staff, and students, the investitures and lectures. Or the
pleasure of just walking across the Quad as students rush between classes.
Those moments confirm to me how vibrant this university is and how engaged
its people are in the issues that concern our nation. 

One snapshot in particular was the morning I sat at the Krannert Center for
the Performing Arts with two of my grandchildren listening to Aaron
Copeland's ""Lincoln Portrait."" I thought back to my earliest memory of that
piece - listening to it on the Mall in DC and hearing Adlai Stevenson
recite the wonderful words that included the phrase ""the occasion is piled
high with difficulty.""

It struck me that those words are being used with increased frequency and
decibels lately as we as a nation struggle with the recession, two wars,
and, lately, even the swine flu.  

But I would also add that the occasion - this singular moment in time at
Illinois - is rife with opportunity.

The reason that Illinois is such a great institution with limitless
opportunity, and will remain as such long past our short tenure here, is
its people (all of you reading this especially) and our broad, diverse
offerings - our palette of arts and culture, science and technology -
Krannert to NCSA, if you will. Commencement is a time to remind ourselves
of our greatness.

Commencement should also make all of us proud to be stewards of Illinois.
As such we must continue to be mindful that in all that we undertake
excellence must be our ordinary and only standard, whether in teaching, in
research, or in service.  That is one of our most precious core values, a
value, by the way, controlled more by motivation than by resources. 

Last fall when the recession hit its downward stride I said that my only
fear was that in responding to the crisis that we would turn away from our
bold ambitions and retreat into the hard shell of average; that the
exigencies of the near term would keep us from engaging and formulating the
unpredictable and serendipitous - the cornerstones of this university. 

In fact, the opposite happened. You continue to amaze. You continue to
follow the creative path of extraordinary. You chose to move forward toward
a future less bound by the present and the past, while, at the same time,
adhering to the bold values which have defined this great university. 

Our reward comes on May 17 at Assembly Hall when the first graduates of the
Class of 2009 receive their diplomas. This day, too, will be rife with
opportunity. 

Thank you for another great year and thank you for all you do for Illinois.

With gratitude,

Richard Herman

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Inclusive Environment","Dear Campus Community:

The continuing assaults on the Native American public art displays along 
Nevada Avenue are not only unlawful and malicious. They are also an 
assault on the values and fabric of Illinois. In other words, our 
university has also been vandalized.  

This is unacceptable and I condemn these recent acts in the strongest 
language. 

I am confident we will catch the culprits responsible but there is other 
work that also demands our full attention. 

We need to begin thinking of these crimes differently. First, let us not 
view this as happening to someone else. What threatens one member of our 
community threatens all of us. We are all diminished in the wake of such 
an act. Indeed, Illinois is diminished and that should concern our 
community. 

Secondly, let us remember what this university stands for. Illinois has 
always stood for the respect and dignity of all people and thought. We are 
the home of the widest interpretation of free speech and expression. We 
are the home of spirited debate along the confines of respect and 
civility. But we do not tolerate acts of intimidation, violence or hate. 

Let me be clear. This is our very lifeblood. This is our DNA as a great 
public university. When our foundation as an inclusive and welcoming 
campus is threatened we need to unite as a community and collectively 
stand as one voice in condemnation. We have done so in the past and we 
will do so at this crucial moment. 

Let us reaffirm our commitment to making Illinois a safe, tolerant, and 
inclusive environment for everyone.

Re: Faculty Suggestions for Provost Search Committee

As you know, Chancellor Richard Herman has announced that Provost Linda
Katehi has accepted a position as Chancellor of the University of
California at Davis.  As a result, the Senate Committee on Committees
has been asked to develop a slate of nominees for the selection of a new
provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs.

According to procedures approved by the Senate, a Provost Search
Committee will consist of about 11 members: eight faculty (five elected by 
the Senate; three appointed by the Chancellor), two students (one elected 
by the student senators; one appointed by the Chancellor), and one academic
professional appointed by the Chancellor. One or more of the faculty
appointees may have administrative appointments. The Chancellor will
appoint a chair from among the eight faculty members. The composition of
the Search Committee is identical to recent provost searches.

The Committee on Committees will present to the Senate 10 to 12 names
for the five faculty positions.  We will be holding an online election
before the end of May.  In lieu of floor nominations, therefore, we ask
that faculty suggest names to the Committee on Committees for membership
on the Search Committee.  Suggestions that represent the diverse
perspectives of the University are welcome.

Please check your email regularly for notice of the URL and time
parameters for this election; you will need your net I.D. (i.e., the
portion of your email address that precedes @illinois.edu) and your
password to login and participate in this election.

Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), students will be notified of a change to
the campus definition of directory information.  The list of items defined
will be expanded to include the University Identification Number (UIN). 
The revised policy will be incorporated in the Student Code and in OBFS
policy.  
 
It is important to note that UINs should not be treated any differently
until the September 1, 2009 reclassification date.  By that time, students
will receive their required annual FERPA notification.

i-card Programs creates, owns, and is the authoritative source for UINs. 
In conjunction with the campus Registrars and other appropriate
individuals, we want to remind all units of the policy forbidding use of
the UIN for authentication (that is, as a password/means to access private
information). The ban went into effect in 2006, when UIN authentication was
retired and i-card Programs started denying incoming requests to use the
UIN for authentication. Adherence to the ban is particularly important
under the FERPA reclassification.  If your unit currently uses UINs as a
means to access private data, please see the website listed below for more
information.

I write today with mixed emotions. Provost and Vice Chancellor for 
Academic Affairs Linda Katehi has accepted the position of chancellor at 
the University of California at Davis, pending approval by their Board of 
Regents. We are losing an individual of strong intellect, a leader with 
considerable capacity to guide our academic units, and a nationally 
respected scholar. When you appoint individuals of this caliber, you know 
they will be constantly recruited. The position at UC-Davis is an 
exceptional opportunity for Linda. 

Dr. Katehi has achieved much in her three years at Illinois. She has 
recruited talented academic leaders, guided the strategic planning 
process, helped launch the Division of Biomedical Sciences, assisted in 
securing the petascale award and implemented the IT@Illinois effort. She 
will be missed on campus and as a representative of our institution in a 
variety of external forums. We wish her and her husband, Spyros 
Tseregounis, well and we know that they will always be a part of the

An interim provost will be named soon after appropriate consultation with 
individuals including the Council of Deans and the Senate. A search for a 
new provost will begin as quickly as possible.

Public health officials on campus and throughout the world are 
investigating outbreaks of swine influenza - commonly known as swine flu.


The outbreak is ongoing and additional cases are expected.


The symptoms of swine flu in people are similar to the symptoms of 
seasonal flu in humans and may include fever of greater than 100 degrees 
F, sore throat, cough, stuffy nose, chills, headache and body aches, and 
fatigue.


To prevent the spread of swine flu, avoid contact with ill persons; when 
you cough or sneeze, cover your nose and mouth with a tissue or your 
sleeve (if you don?t have a tissue), and throw the tissue in a trash can; 
after coughing or sneezing, wash your hands with soap and water, or use an 
alcohol-based hand gel; if you think you are will with flu, avoid close 
contact with others as much as possible, and stay at home or in your hotel 
room. Seek medical care if you are severely ill (such as having trouble 
breathing).

panic, depression, anxiety, excessive fatigue, avoidance, confusion or who 
report such conditions as their ""mind goes blank,"" may need your help and 
encouragement in seeking assistance.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Budget Update","To:    Members of the University of Illinois Community
From:  President B. Joseph White
Re:    Budget Update

  I write to provide an update on where things stand regarding the 
University of Illinois budget for fiscal 2009 and 2010.

  The work of the University is education, research and service, including 
health care delivery. We are fortunate in that our work, in general, has 
not declined as it has in so many organizations during the severe economic 
recession of the last sixteen months.  We have just as many students to 
educate as a year ago, no fewer research grants and contracts to fulfill, 
the same number of buildings to maintain, and so on.  We have financial 
challenges to manage, but in general we are holding our own during a very 
difficult time.

  The total budget deficit for the state of Illinois for fiscal year 2009 
(July 1, 2008-June 30, 2009) and 2010 (July 1, 2009-June 30, 2010) is 
estimated to be more than a combined $11 billion. Last fall, the 
University was directed to reserve 2.5 percent of its fiscal 2009 
operating appropriation, and we did so without impacting our core missions 
or employment thanks to prudent financial planning. Now, Gov. Pat Quinn 
has proposed a fiscal 2010 budget that would restore the 2.5 percent 
rescission and provide a 1.1 percent increase in the U of I general 
operating appropriation. Included in the governor's spending priorities 
are additional funds for student assistance and capital support for 
renovation of existing buildings and construction of new facilities.

  The Illinois Senate and House have begun their legislative deliberations 
and I am cautiously optimistic that the final state budget will provide 
additional support for higher education and the U of I. We take nothing 
for granted given the state's fiscal condition, but in several recent 
trips to the Statehouse, I have found that our message of the University's 
value has been well received by Senators and Representatives, legislative 
leaders and Gov. Quinn. During U of I Lobby Day on April 1 nearly 200 
students and alumni representing all three campuses fanned out through the 
Capitol to make our case to their respective legislators.

  In Washington, the federal economic stimulus plan (American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act of 2009) passed by Congress contains numerous beneficial 
provisions. These include additional student financial aid grants to keep 
college accessible and affordable, as well as funds to assist the state 
with our operating budget. Also, the plan invests billions more in new 
money for science and research that our faculty, provosts and vice 
chancellors for research, and their staffs, are pursuing aggressively. As 
in Springfield, we are in touch with these federal funding agencies and 
members of the Illinois congressional delegation to make our case.

  In sum, our aspiration is to be part of the solution to the severe 
economic downturn and not to add to the problem. We want to keep our 
people working--stimulating the economy, educating our citizens and making 
the discoveries that will keep Illinois and America globally competitive. 
When a decision about tuition for 2009-10 is made this spring, our desire 
will be to hold it to a level that recognizes the financial circumstances 
of students and their families in a troubled economy. 

  The Trustees and I are mindful of the need to prudently manage the 
institution, and we deeply appreciate your on-going efforts to contain 
costs while maintaining quality. While the near-term future is uncertain, 
I am confident that the University of Illinois will weather this storm, as 
it has countless others over 140 years, and will continue to be the 
state's most valuable asset in creating a prosperous future for our 
citizens.

  A website --  -- 
established last fall and updated regularly continues to be your best 
central source of information about the state budget, the federal stimulus 
package, University plans and priorities, internal communications and 
ongoing media coverage of the economy. 

  Again, my thanks for all you do for our students and the University.  I 
will keep you posted as new developments occur.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Notice about Changes in Income Tax Withholding","This e-mail message applies to all employees of the University of  
Illinois.

The IRS has issued new tax tables to reduce federal tax withholding 
required by the new economic stimulus law, the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act of 2009.  For 2009 and 2010, the Making Work Pay 
provision of the stimulus bill provides a reduction in withholding of 
$400 for those claiming Single on the Form W-4, and $600 for those 
claiming Married on Form W-4.

The new tables will be effective with payrolls paid in April. Eligible 
University employees will get the benefit of the reduced withholding 
without any action on their part. The new tax tables will adjust the 
withholding automatically.

However, there may be situations where individuals will be under withheld 
if no action is taken:

*If an individual works for more than one employer the new tax tables 
will provide the reduced withholding for both employers.  This would 
reduce the withholding by more than what an individual would be entitled 
to.

*Married couples with both spouses working and claiming married on the 
Form W-4 will also see the reduction in withholding for both spouses.  
This would reduce the withholding by more than what the married couple 
would be entitled to. 

*Individuals claimed as a dependent on another individual's tax return 
are not eligible for the reduced withholding.  The reduction is automatic 
and could result in under-withholding for the year.

*Nonresident aliens are not entitled to the reduced withholding.  The 
calculations are adjusted so that the reduction is not applied to most 
nonresident alien withholding.  However, the calculation adjustment does 
not apply to students and business apprentices from India.  Individuals 
in this category may be under-withheld in their taxes for the year.  

In the situations described above, if you want to make sure the 
appropriate withholding is applied, you need to file a new Form W-4. You 
may claim fewer withholding allowances on line 5 or request additional 
amounts to be withheld on line 6. 

If you are unsure what you should submit on the Form W-4, you can use the 
IRS Withholding Calculator to determine what you would need to claim so 
that you do not owe taxes at the end of the year.  The calculator is 
found at: .

Subject:	Armed Robbery Advisory

The Champaign Police Department is investigating a report of an armed 
robbery that occurred Thursday night (March 12) at about 9:35 in the 200 
block of East John Street.

A female victim was walking east on John Street when she was approached by 
two male suspects.

One suspect, wearing a white shirt, waved a hand as if motioning to 
someone. As the victim continued walking, the other suspect, wearing a 
black hooded sweatshirt, ran out from behind a large bush in front of 202 
E. John St. and showed a black semi-automatic handgun and told the victim 
to stop.

The suspect wearing the shirt ran toward the victim and grabbed her by an 
arm. The other suspect threatened the victim with the handgun and took a 
small, black, wallet-sized purse.

The suspects ran south across John into the east parking lot of Beckwith 
Hall, 201 E. John St. The victim ran after the suspects and yelled for 
help.

The suspect wearing the sweatshirt reportedly fired one or two shots 
toward the victim.  The victim, who ran into Beckwith Hall, was not 
injured.

The suspects are described as black, about 5 feet 10 inches tall, thin, 
and in their late teens to early 20s. Both were wearing blue jeans and do-
rags.

The U. of I. Police Department is increasing patrols as a result of this 
incident and is working with the Champaign Police Department to identify 
and arrest the suspects. The department also urges victims not to 
challenge dangerous suspects if threatened.

Anyone with information about this incident should call the Champaign 
Police Department at 217-351-4545.  Information also can be shared 
anonymously through Crimestoppers by calling 217-373-TIPS or online at 
http://www.champaigncountycrimestoppers.com/

Police encourage the campus community to report suspicious behavior and 
take actions to remove the opportunity for a crime to occur.  Individuals 
are reminded to use well-lit and busy sidewalks whenever possible. Also, 
avoid walking alone or walking near vacant lots, alleys, or construction 
sites.  Stay alert at all times and immediately report any suspicious 
activity to police. Safety tips can be found on the U. of I. Police 
Department Web page at

As you know, our campus experienced a power outage on Sunday that affected 
most University buildings including residence halls. I am pleased that our 
emergency response systems worked quite effectively, notifying the campus 
of the situation and providing updates as the day went on. I want to thank 
everyone involved in keeping the campus community both safe and informed 
yesterday.

I would ask that faculty and staff work with their students regarding 
deadlines related to exams and assignments. Many students were not able to 
access online course materials and email throughout the day, and 
facilities in residence halls also experienced some disruption. Many 
students who had planned to complete assignments or prepare for exams were 
unable to do so adequately throughout most of the day on Sunday. Although 
I encourage you to continue to hold our students to the highest of 
academic standards, I would also ask that you be understanding and 
accommodating with regard to Sunday's difficulties.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Illini-Alert Test March 3","Last week the campus completed its first full-scale test of the new 
emergency notification system, Illini-Alert. I write to let you know that 
we will be performing another test of the product on Tuesday, Mar. 3 at 
10:00 a.m. 

If you are not registered to receive notifications, please do so 
immediately. If you were already registered, be sure to take a moment to 
verify that we have the correct contact information for you by following 
the instructions at: https://emergency.illinois.edu/enrolling.aspx. 

To register or verify your information go to: 
http://emergency.illinois.edu.

The initial test of the system successfully pushed email notifications to 
more than 100,000 addresses in under six minutes. Text messaging was 
generally successful, but approximately 3,500 text messages were rejected 
by one cellphone provider. The source of this problem has been addressed, 
and we believe the rate of text messages will now equal or exceed that of 
email notifications. For your safety, however, we are rerunning the test 
on March 3rd to confirm that success.

It is important to remind everyone that there is no way to guarantee the 
delivery of any specific notification. Therefore, I want to encourage 
everyone, if possible, to take full advantage of the system by providing 
both an alternate email address as well as a cell phone number for text 
messaging.

Large third-party providers such as Gmail and Yahoo still may flag some of 
these email messages as spam. If you do not receive your email messages to 
third party accounts on Tuesday, please check your junk mail or spam 
folders and mark the notifications as 'not spam.' That should minimize 
blocked emergency messages from occurring in the future.

On behalf of the campus administration, I thank you for your participation 
and your patience as we work to enhance campus safety.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Unofficial St. Patrick's Day - March 6","On Friday, March 6, 2009, many Campustown bars, students, and visitors 
will participate in a commercial event known as Unofficial St. Patrick's 
Day. While the University does not support or condone this event, steps 
are being taken to ensure the safety of students who choose to 
participate, and to minimize disruption to classes and campus operations.

Champaign police, assisted by other local and state agencies, will patrol 
Campustown on March 6. They will enforce all applicable ordinances in 
commercial areas, and have been given authority to intervene if private 
parties threaten to disturb the peace. In addition, Champaign and Urbana 
officials will enact restrictions on liquor sales intended to curb 
overconsumption. Emergency medical personnel will be available to provide 
care.

University police will focus on protecting students, staff, faculty, and 
University property. In case of emergency, call METCAD at 911 (from 
campus phones, call 9-911). For non-emergencies, call 333-1216.

As in years past, we have made clear to students that academic business 
will continue as usual on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. That has helped 
to minimize disruptions. Instructors should not need to alter 
instructional plans.

The Student Code (http://www.admin.uiuc.edu/policy/code/) addresses 
student responsibilities on campus. Sections 1-102(d) and 1-302(f) 
concern classroom conduct expectations, and section 1-307 focuses on 
alcohol consumption. The Code empowers instructors to ask disruptive 
students to leave class; after class, names of disruptive students should 
be reported to the Office for Student Conflict Resolution at 333-3680 or 
online at 
http://www.conflictresolution.uiuc.edu/forms/incidentReport/form.asp.

If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into a 
confrontation, you may seek assistance. From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on March 
6, teams of Student Affairs and Academic Affairs professionals will walk 
through and around buildings with classrooms and lecture halls where 
disruptions were experienced in the past. Team members, wearing 
University IDs, may be summoned to help. Teams will be prepared to 
document apparent Code violations and to call University police, if 
necessary.

Students will be asked not to bring any liquids into Foellinger 
Auditorium. (Longstanding policy prohibits liquids and food in 
Foellinger.)

Students who interfere with the academic mission of the University will 
face serious consequences. Thank you for reinforcing this message before 
and on March 6.

Welcome back to campus. During the holiday break, the University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign began the switch to a new provider for the 
emergency text notification system, so we could provide you better 
service.

The new system, which is offered by a company called MyStateUSA, has 
several improved features:

* It allows you to test the system yourself.

* It allows you to include two additional contacts, say your parents, 
your guardian or your spouse.

* It sends messages at ""true text"" speed, greatly reducing delivery times 
compared to the previous system.

* It is easier to register with this provider. You don't need to input 
the email address of your phone provider, just submit your actual phone 
number.

* It is not hosted on campus so, in the event of a major crisis here, it 
will not be in danger of breaking.

But the system will not work without your help. 

* If you have not registered, go to emergency.illinois.edu and register 
now. 

* If you registered for the old system, go to emergency.illinois.edu and 
verify that we have your current contact information, as well as the 
contact information for the two people you want us to include.

* Be prepared for tests of the system. We will alert you about tests (the 
first will be Tuesday Feb. 17 at approximately 10:00 a.m.). If you do not 
receive a test message during the test, please contact the CITES Help 
Desk at (217) 244-7000 or consult@illinois.edu.

* Be prepared for an actual emergency. Go to www.dps.illinois.edu and 
click on 'Safety Resources' now and learn what you can do to protect 
yourself. 

* In an actual emergency, please follow the instructions we will give you 
through our other emergency communications systems (i.e., email, text, 
campus Web site, campus building telephone tree, etc.).

I wish you a safe and productive semester.

I write to thank everyone who participated in our town hall meeting.  It 
is important that we continue to work together to address the critical 
challenges we are facing because of the state's uncertain financial 
situation.  

A summary of the town hall meeting, a description of ongoing initiatives, 
an FAQ, and a virtual ideas box to receive your suggestions have been 
posted at the following url: 
http://provost.illinois.edu/stewardingourresources/index.html.  Through 
this means we will continue to receive input from those of you who have 
additional comments and recommendations.  

Whether you attended the session at Foellinger Auditorium or participated 
via the online or broadcast facilities, I commend you for taking the time 
to learn and share ideas about how we can remain a great and valuable 
institution.  We are a premier institution today and together we will 
remain so in the years to come. 

Many of you made suggestions about how we might navigate the choppy 
economic waters we sail in, while remaining true to our cornerstone values 
and principles:  quality programs and assurance that we provide our 
students with an educational experience that will prepare them to be 
leaders. 

A clear, resounding and recurring message was delivered during the town 
hall meeting - protect jobs.  While it would be reckless for me to make 
such promises without knowing the impact of the state's financial 
situation on the university, what I can assure you is that the highest 
possible priority will be protecting people and their jobs. 

Provost Katehi and I continue to work with the campus leadership team to 
chart our course.  As we learn more about the state's financial situation, 
we will share that information.  We will draw upon all of the ideas that 
have been and will be tendered so that we can make the best informed 
decisions.  We look forward to hearing from you.  Many thanks for your 
continued participation at this critical time in Illinois' history.

Subject:  MASSMAIL - Notice Regarding Graduate-Level Tuition Waivers

This notice is to remind employees of an important benefit to Faculty, 
Civil Service and Academic Professional employees who are taking graduate-
level courses and who are eligible to receive a tuition waiver at the 
University.  If you are not receiving a graduate level tuition waiver or 
do not plan on receiving one this calendar year this notice does not 
apply to you.

The university exempts the first $5,250 of the tuition waiver from 
taxable income in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 127.  
This exemption is based on tuition waivers received by an employee in a 
calendar year.  

University Payroll monitors waivers posted to employees' student 
accounts.  When the value exceeds the exempted amount of $5,250, the 
employee is notified of the taxability.  The notification will be in the 
form of an email and via the U.S. Postal Service to the mailing address 
in Banner.  Information regarding applying for an exception to the 
taxation, if applicable, will be sent at that time.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - University financial outlook","January 21, 2009

To:     Members of the University community
From:   B. Joseph White
Re:     University financial outlook

  Since I wrote to you in late October about our financial outlook, the 
global financial crisis has become a worldwide recession.  At least 43 
states -- Illinois included -- face revenue shortfalls in the current 
fiscal year with consequences for their public universities.

  Last week I briefed the Board of Trustees on our financial outlook.  I 
also spoke with leaders of 15 organizations that represent different 
groups of University employees to brief them and pledge cooperation in 
working together through difficult financial times.
	
  In this message, I want to brief you.  First, let me remind you of what 
I said in my October message: that the University of Illinois, in our 142 
year history, has been through good times and hard times, periods of war 
and stretches of peace, campus tranquility and campus turmoil.  Through it 
all, those who preceded us endured and built a great institution.  We 
intend to do the same in the circumstances we face.

  The situation in Illinois is this: the revenue shortfall for fiscal 2008-
09 is conservatively estimated to be $2.1 billion, and the state has a $4 
billion to $5 billion backlog in unpaid bills; the leadership situation in 
the state leaves us without clear direction on how much state-supported 
budgets may have to be reduced; and we must plan for fiscal 2010 in which 
economic conditions will continue to be difficult.

  In light of this situation, the University's leaders -- chancellors and 
provosts, vice presidents, and deans and directors -- have prepared 
contingency plans to handle a significant rescission of our fiscal 2009 
appropriation should it come from the state in the next several months.

  The planning has been guided by three principles: protect academic 
quality; serve well students and others who depend on us; and minimize 
adverse effects on our people.

  Our plan is to handle a rescission by continuing the freeze on all 
except essential hiring that has been in place for the last three months 
and substantially reducing purchases, travel and other expenses.  We will 
do our best to avoid significant budget-driven layoffs.  However, in light 
of the financial circumstances some units of the University may face, I 
cannot provide complete assurance, especially if the rescission is large.

  With regard to fiscal 2010 that begins July 1, 2009, there is 
substantial uncertainty about what our situation will be.  If the 
recession deepens, if state revenues decline more, and if there is not 
help for the states and higher education from the Obama administration, 
fiscal 2010 could be a very difficult year.  Should this be the case, 
there will be great pressure on all our costs at the University, of which 
75 percent are faculty and staff.  I cannot rule out the kinds of actions 
that we see occurring in some other states now, including voluntary and 
mandatory furlough days.  I hope these will not be needed but we will keep 
you posted as the picture develops.

  Each campus has scheduled a town hall meeting to discuss the budget 
outlook.  I urge you to participate in these meetings to gain a better 
understanding of the challenges we face.

  This week, like many of you, I watched with great pride and admiration 
the inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president of the United 
States.  He called on us to look ahead, work together and make the changes 
required for a better future.  This is exactly what we need to do at the 
University of Illinois as we get through difficult times that will give 
way to that better future.

  Thank you for your excellent work and for your membership in the 
University community.  I look forward to continuing to work together.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Credit Card Convenience Fee Increase","Effective February 1, 2009, the University of Illinois is increasing its 
credit card convenience fee from 2.0% to 2.4%. This increase is entirely 
due to higher fees being assessed by the card brands that are accepted 
for tuition and fees.  The rate charged by the University solely reflects 
the fees incurred for processing these transactions, no additional 
revenue is generated. If in the future, credit card company rates 
decline, the convenience fee will be reduced. The Office of Business and 
Financial Services will monitor the rate charged on a regular basis.  As 
always, we encourage students and parents to consider the free e-check 
option for tuition bill payment.
Inquiries specifically about the increasing convenience fee should be

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Illinois Compass Password Change","Dear Student,

This message provides important information about logging in to your
courses on Illinois Compass beginning January 14, 2009.

On Wednesday, January 14, Illinois Compass will begin using an Active
Directory (AD) password for logging in (for example, this would be the same
password that is used for CITES NetFiles).  We suggest that you allow extra
time when logging in to Illinois Compass for the first time this semester
in case you have forgotten or need to create an AD password.  If you have
difficulty logging in, you may need to use the CITES Password Manager
 to set your password.  Please
note, the new Password Manager makes it easy to set a single password for
many CITES services and you may wish to take this opportunity to
consolidate your passwords.

For more information about CITES passwords, please see

As we near the close of our 2008 Campus Charitable Fund Drive, we want to 
tell you how proud we are to work alongside such caring and generous 
colleagues. In the midst of a serious recession, when it seems that all 
the news about the economy is gloomy, you nonetheless stepped forward and 
opened your hearts to those in need. 

As a result, our active and retired employees have raised $1.375 million 
dollars. Not only does this mean that many agencies will have the much-
needed funds they require, it also represents in very real terms that 
margin of difference for thousands of our neighbors in central Illinois. 

Because of you, we are now a mere $25,000 away from our goal of raising 
$1.4 million. And, as we have reminded our volunteer leaders, we will 
continue to accept donations at www.ccfd.illinois until December 15. 

The measure of what it means to be human is to regard the plight of 
others. Your generosity affirms to us that it is woven deep within the

chose to receive their W-2 electronically. The consent process for 
calendar year 2008 is open through January 18, 2009.

If You Previously Consented:
You do NOT need to provide consent again this year to retrieve your 2008

Benefits of accessing your Form W-2 online include:
* You will have access to your Form W-2 at least two weeks earlier than 
the distribution of mailed copies.  
* Your Form W-2 is always available to you for secure, convenient and 
timely access.
* Because you are retrieving your Form W-2 electronically from a secured 
Web site, you need not worry that the form will be lost in the mail or 
stolen from your mailbox and used for identity theft.
* Duplicates are just a few clicks away, even as late as April 14 or 15.

=============================================
2. CONSENT PROCESS FOR ELECTRONIC ACCESS

click ""Continue."" 
8. Follow the instructions at the bottom of the form to provide consent: 
  (1) Enter the consent code (click on link to retrieve the code. This is 
  necessary since it is the same functionality used to retrieve the W-2 
  electronically.) 
  (2) Enter the e-mail address you want your notification regarding 
  retrieval of your Form W-2 to be addressed to. 
  (3) Re-enter your e-mail address. 
9. Click the ""Consent"" button. 

After you submit this information, you will receive an e-mail from the 
University of Illinois indicating you have consented to receive your W-2

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Campus Economic Outlook","Dear Colleagues,

You have recently received a message from President White on the economic
outlook for all of the campuses of the University of Illinois.  He has
charged leadership of each campus with the task of designing contingency
plans to cover whatever financial realities we ultimately face in light of
the declining state and national economies.  I write to you today to assure
you that thoughtful planning is under way with our campus administrators
including the vice chancellors, the Chancellor's Cabinet, the Council of
Deans, and directors and department heads. Representatives of the faculty,
staff, and students will also be involved through the Senate and other
advisory bodies.

I have personally experienced this situation twice before - once here, once
elsewhere - and on each occasion I saw a stronger institution emerge.  This
is possible again if the answers to the financial questions we face are
grounded in sound institutional principles and values. We must (and will)
find ways to respond to our financial circumstances that build on our
accomplishments of recent years, allow us to continue our forward movement,
and protect our missions of teaching, research, economic development, and
public engagement.  

Should we face this challenge, we will have to make prudent, focused
decisions. We must examine anew what is most important to our missions and
our aspirations, what must be protected, and where investments must still
be made. Guided by the campus' strategic plan we developed a shared vision
for this institution which requires us to: 

o assure student access to a quality education across all income levels;
o safeguard the quality of our faculty and the education we offer;
o secure the base of excellence for which we are justly known-our research
activities and related engagement with the public; and 
o preserve our capacity to selectively invest in high potential endeavors.

The means by which we implement these principles will need to be devised
through careful collaboration under our shared governance model. One thing
is clear: we will need to engage our collective entrepreneurial energies to
seek additional sources of funding. Hence greater efforts to raise
resources from individuals, the private sector, foundations and agencies,
must be encouraged.  And to that end, we must continue to argue that public
higher education is a social good and an essential investment in meeting
society's critical needs. This is not a time for retrenchment or scaling
back our aspirations for the future. The next several years will be
challenging ones for all of us, but if we manage our way wisely through
this challenging time we will emerge on the other side positioned to move
ahead rapidly as new funds become available. 

I am asking each of you to be sensitive to others in this trying time and
recognize that there may be members of our community who are experiencing a
particularly stressful period.  Please look at how work is accomplished
within your unit and share your suggestions as to how to work smarter, with
greater economies.  Mindful that personnel, equipment and utilities
comprise the largest components of our expenses, I ask that, where
possible, you delay creating new jobs, filling vacancies, or making
equipment purchases and to redouble our efforts to conserve resources on
campus. 
 
Your excellence and dedication are our most valuable resources for
addressing the challenges that this period brings. The campus has for a
long time been a wonderful place to make a career. The larger economic
downturn will not, and cannot, be allowed to change that.  

Very truly yours,

Richard Herman

 Subject: Threatening Note","As the Halloween weekend approaches, I write to update you on the 
investigation of a threatening note recently found in the Library. The 
task force established to investigate this threat continues to work toward 
identifying the author and assessing the credibility of the note. Despite 
our efforts, we have no information to lead us to believe the threat is 
any more or less credible than we did when it was first discovered.

The note stated that on Oct. 3, the note's author had damaged a vehicle 
window at the Savoy 16 Theaters at 232 W. Burwash Ave., Savoy. The note 
threatened that on Halloween night (Oct. 31), the suspect intends to shoot 
a person on Green Street.

More specifically, the note stated that ""On Oct. 3rd 2008 I Used a Ruger 
22. caliber rifle to take shot at a black sedan in parking lot of Savoy 
Theatre."" The note further stated that ""On Halloween Night 2008"" another 
shot will be taken ""on Green Street in the night life district.""

We are asking the campus community again for your help in identifying the 
person who left the note. If you have any information regarding who may 
have written the note or damaged the vehicle in Savoy, contact the 
University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216, or you may 
anonymously contact Crime Stoppers by calling 217-373-8477, by submitting 
anonymous tips online at www.373tips.com or by texting Tip397 plus the 
relevant information to 274637 (CRIMES).

Contrary to rumors circulating on campus, this is the ONLY threat we have 
received.

Although this note may be some sort of hoax or prank, we are taking it 
extremely seriously. It is also understandable that this threat is causing 
much concern for students, parents and the university community. We remain 
hopeful that the author of the note will come forward or can be identified 
prior to Halloween to relieve these concerns.

A separate task force has been planning police operations on Halloween.  
Additional police resources, assets, strategies and tactics will be 
deployed as needed throughout the campus district.

People have asked whether they should avoid Green Street on Halloween 
night. Some may choose to not be present where the threat was focused, but 
no matter where you are, we advise you to always be aware of your 
surroundings and to immediately report any suspicious activity to the 
police. 

If you are celebrating Halloween by wearing a costume, you absolutely 
should NOT carry any type of replica, toy or fake weapon. 

We encourage you to sign up for the UI Emergency Notification System at 
emergency.illinois.edu.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Interim Police Chief Jeff Christensen

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Contributions of Compensable Sick & Vacation Leave","University employees have the opportunity to participate in retirement 
savings plans in addition to SURS, where the employee chooses investment 
option(s) within the plan and invests pre-tax dollars through 
voluntary ""salary reduction.""  Employee contributions, together with 
interest and earnings accumulation, are deferred from federal and state 
income taxes until the funds are withdrawn. 

Two retirement savings plans are available to University employees:  (1) 
the University of Illinois Supplemental 403(b) Retirement Plan, and (2) 
the State of Illinois 457 Deferred Compensation Plan.  Under both the 
University 403(b) and State of Illinois 457 Deferred Compensation Plans, 
employees who are approaching retirement or separation from University 
service are allowed to make contributions to their 403(b) or 457 plans 
from their accrued compensable sick and vacation leave payout. The 
policies related to this process have been updated to clarify procedures 
and adjust deadline requirements, as follows:

* FOR PLAN 403(B) - The employee must have an account set up with an 
approved investment provider under the plan.  The employee must also 
submit a completed Salary Reduction Agreement form to his/her campus 
Benefits Service Center at least 20 days prior to the last date of 
employment. 

* FOR PLAN 457 - The employee must submit a Deferred Compensation 
Election form to his/her campus Benefits Service Center during the 
calendar month prior to the beginning of the final pay period in which 
the employee will work.   For example, the form should be received by the 
campus Benefits Service Center no later than March 31 if the employee's 
last pay period of work will BEGIN in April.

* The employee's DEPARTMENT must ensure that accurate and appropriate 
compensable sick and vacation leave payouts are approved by the 
department and submitted to the University Payroll office no later than 
45 days after the last date of employment.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - University Outlook","As you know, we have been experiencing a global financial crisis and 
weakening U.S. and Illinois economies. 

I write to let you know what this may mean for the University of Illinois 
and how we are preparing for whatever financial conditions we could face 
in the months ahead. 

My message is that we must be prepared for the possibility of reduced 
state support, some students and families struggling with tuition bills, 
difficult research grant and contract conditions, and reduced income from 
the University's endowment. 

The U.S. and Illinois economies are weakening rapidly as evidenced by 
rising unemployment and other indicators. While the outlook is uncertain, 
we may be in the early stage of serious recessionary conditions. 

Already we are seeing signs of difficult times with more likely to come. 
Most notable are weak state revenues and slow disbursements to state 
agencies, including the University, and a reduction in the value of the 
University's endowment that reflects the serious decline in U.S. and 
global equity markets. 

Overall, the University is in a reasonable position financially to weather 
a difficult economic period. We have diversified revenue sources, some 
financial reserves, and a strong credit rating. We cannot, however, fully 
immunize ourselves from the painful effects of a severe recession, should 
one occur. 

Experience has taught me that to deal with the effects of a recession 
wisely, we must plan for the worst while we hope for the best. That is 
exactly what University leaders -- vice presidents, chancellors and 
provosts, deans and directors -- are doing. 

I have directed University leaders to prepare contingency plans for 
whatever financial hardships may come our way in the next six to 18 
months. Immediately, we must save money by not filling many open jobs and 
by controlling expenditures of all kinds. Further action will be required 
if financial conditions worsen. 

I expect to receive and review these plans in the next several weeks. We 
will then brief the Board of Trustees, faculty governance groups, and 
representatives of employee and student groups. While strong leadership is 
necessary to navigate a period of financial difficulty, the University is 
a family and we want all members of the family to be fully informed and 
involved as appropriate in determining how to manage through hard times. 

I believe that three principles should guide our approach to dealing with 
tough financial times for the University:

* Protect the academic quality that has been built over many decades. 
* Ensure students have access to the courses and programs they need and 
patients have access to the clinical health care on which they depend.
* Share in a thoughtful and fair way whatever sacrifices are required.

This is a good time to remember that we are the stewards of a great 
University that has experienced and successfully weathered nearly every 
challenge over its 140-year history: booms and busts, recessions and 
recoveries, wars and homecomings, turbulence and triumphs. Through it all, 
the University of Illinois has persevered and thrived. I assure you that 
this will again be the case in the present circumstances. 

Thank you for your work and your membership in the University of Illinois 
community. We will keep you posted in the months ahead.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Holiday Schedule/Reduced Service days","TO:        All Civil Service and Academic Professional Employees

FROM:   Elyne Cole, Associate Provost for Human Resources

DATE:	  October 20, 2008

RE:	  Holiday Schedule/Reduced Service Days 


We are rapidly approaching the holiday season and I wanted to remind you 
of the holiday schedule, which will once again be accompanied by a period 
of Reduced Service Days.  An exact list of the holidays and reduced 
service days for December and January can be found at:  


Please note this is the first year that there will be four reduced 
service days over the holiday period.  Employees have two floating 
holidays that can be used any time from July 1, 2008, until June 30, 
2009, which could be used to cover two of the four reduced service days.  
Departments are strongly encouraged to begin planning for this period and 
discussing these plans with their employees.  Employees should review 
their leave balances available for usage during the reduced service 
days.  


CONSIDERATIONS FOR EMPLOYEES

Gift/Excused Day:

* Staff employees who are required to work any part of that day will be 
compensated in accordance with Policy and Rules, Rule 11.13 (Excused 
Absence with Pay/Gift Day)
.

* This is a gift/excused day.  Employees will not use benefits to cover 
this day.

* For payroll time reporting purposes, time for non-exempt staff 
employees should be recorded as regular hours.  Exempt employees will not 
record any hours, since they record only exception time (e.g., vacation 
or sick leave usage).


Reduced Service Days: 
* It is expected that most units will be closed and most employees will 
not be working on these four days.

* Employees may use floating holidays or vacation to cover this time if 
they do not work.

* In addition, non-exempt employees may use accrued compensatory time or 
take the time without pay.

* Exempt employees who do not have accrued vacation or floating holidays 
to cover this time cannot have their pay docked.  The unit may require 
such employees to work or can work with them to make arrangements so that 
they account for this time in an alternative way.  

* Employees who do not have benefits may choose to work these days.  
Units that plan to be closed during this time AND that have employees who 
want to work during this period should contact the appropriate Human 
Resources office in order to identify alternate worksites for these 
individuals as needed.  Units with staff employees who will be working 
should contact Corbin Smith, Manager of Labor and Employee Relations at 
333-3105 no later than Friday, November 28, 2008.  Units with academic 
employees who want to work should consult with Sharon Reynolds, Associate 
Director of Academic Human Resources at 333-6747.

* Since the reduced service days are not official holidays, employees who 
are required to work and those who choose to work will be paid their 
regular hourly rate of pay.  For payroll time reporting purposes, non-
exempt staff employees who work should record their time for these four 
days as regular hours.  Exempt employees who are required to work on one 
or more of these days should not record anything for the days they work, 
since they record only exception time (e.g., vacation or sick leave 
usage).

I hope our employees are able to take advantage of the opportunity to 
have time off in the period between Christmas and New Year Day.  
Questions regarding reduced service days may be directed to Corbin Smith, 
Manager of Labor and Employee Relations at 333-3105 or Sharon Reynolds,

 Subject: MASSMAIL - University Employees and the IL State Ethics Law","To:	Members of the University Community
From:	B. Joseph White
Re: 	A Message Concerning University Employees and the 
        Illinois State Ethics Act 

I write to you today with a simple message:

We, the leadership of the University of Illinois, will preserve, protect 
and defend the constitutionally guaranteed rights of every member of our 
University community, including, of course, freedom of speech and 
assembly. We will also preserve, protect and defend academic freedom, 
which is a core value of every great academic institution.  

Why am I communicating this assurance?  

Because the University Ethics Office, which reports to me, recently 
disseminated through its newsletter a briefing on the State Officials and 
Employees Ethics Act that was enacted in 2003.  

The newsletter is not a University policy statement. The purpose of the 
briefing was to familiarize us as state employees with the prohibited 
political activities section of the Ethics Act.    

Much of the briefing is simply informative about the state law. For 
example, it is not proper to use University resources to conduct political 
activity, nor is it proper to conduct certain political activities, such 
as soliciting contributions for a party or candidate, while on University 
time.

However, some of the newsletter's content raised concerns among members of 
our community. The briefing cited certain political activities as 
prohibited that conflict, or appear to conflict, with fundamental 
freedoms.  One involves wearing a pin or T-shirt in support of a political 
party or candidate.  Another involves attending a rally on University 
property.  

Are such practices really prohibited by the Ethics Act? To date, the 
courts have given little if any guidance on the proper interpretation of 
the Ethics Act.  

I have heard from many people about this matter.  One of the most 
thoughtful suggested, and I agree, that University employees should be 
advised that they may engage in the following kinds of activities while on 
University property:
 
-- Attend partisan political rallies, provided that the employees 
   are not on duty
-- Wear partisan political buttons, provided that employees at 
   that time are neither on duty nor in the workplace of the 
   University (many parts of campus are not workplaces) 
-- Display partisan bumper stickers on their vehicles

Going forward, I remain concerned about possible conflicts between the 
Ethics Act and interpretations of its meaning and constitutionally 
protected freedoms and academic freedom.  

Accordingly, the Ethics Office, other members of my staff and I will work 
with state officials to ensure that interpretations of the Ethics Act do 
not restrict constitutionally guaranteed rights of state employees and, in 
the case of higher education and this University, academic freedom.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Can You Really Speak Freely on a Public Campus?","September 14, 2008

Dear Colleagues,

I am writing as Chair of the Senate Executive Committee to let you all 
know about an important series of events being planned this year by the 
Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, with participation 
among faculty, students and staff across the campus.

The series is entitled:

Campus Uncensored? Your Rights, Freedoms, and Responsibilities

Purpose: The University is deeply committed to creating and maintaining an 
inclusive, just, and respectful learning community. The University of 
Illinois welcomes and encourages all of its students, faculty, and staff 
to embrace the marketplace of ideas as part of the educational experience. 
It is in this spirit that in 2008-09 the campus will sponsor a series of 
events that highlights the vital roles and meanings of the First Amendment 
and Academic Freedom at the University of Illinois. This program of 
activities has three goals:

To broaden our understanding of the First Amendment. This includes both 
historical and contemporary analyses, and conversations about your rights 
to free speech and other freedoms granted by this amendment;

To enhance awareness of the responsibilities that accompany these 
constitutional rights and freedoms, and;

To encourage students, faculty, and staff to use this understanding and 
awareness for personal and collective application on the campus and in 
everyday life.

The first of the scheduled events is coming this week:

Robert O'Neil 
Wednesday, September 17, 2008 
4:00 pm - 5:30 pm 
213 Gregory Hall
 
""Can You Really Speak Freely on a Public Campus?"" 

The question ""Can You Really Speak Freely on a Public Campus?' is 
deceptively simple. While one might readily assume that a state university 
should provide the freest of all settings, and while it is so in certain 
respects, there are complications. For example, a professor could be 
penalized or even dismissed for egregious plagiarism that would violate no 
civil or criminal laws off campus. This lecture will look more critically 
at this contrast between the public campus and the broader society by 
focusing on three current and contentious issues - regulation of sexually 
harassing speech, restriction of postings by 
extreme animal-rights protesters, and control of profanity and other 
unwelcome speech at state university athletic events. 

Subsequent events will be planned throughout the year, including a faculty 
panel on these issues in February. Watch for more information as the 
schedule is completed:

http://www.studentaffairs.illinois.edu/diversity/uncensored.html

Clearly, first amendment and academic freedom issues go to the heart of 
the kind of campus we want the University of Illinois to be, and many 
recent campus controversies have revolved around conflicting 
understandings of these principles.

I encourage you to take advantage of these events. Where appropriate, you 
might want to include these events, or discussion about them, in your 
courses.

Sincerely,

Nicholas C. Burbules
Chair, Senate Executive Committee

This e-mail is being sent to all students as a reminder of the Student 
Health Insurance Enrollment/Change Period, which runs 08/25/08-09/23/08 
for the Fall 2008 Semester.  This is the only time during the Fall 2008 
semester that students can complete an Open Enrollment Reinstatement, 
apply for Dependent Coverage, apply for permanent Exemption from the 
insurance fee, or apply for an Extension of your Summer 2008 coverage. 
Extensions are only for students not registering for the Fall Semester.  
If you are in an exempt status (not covered under the plan), and you wish 
to remain exempt, you do not need to re-apply for an exemption.  To check 
exempt status, look on your e-bill to see if you have been charged the 
UIUC Student Insurance fee (undergrad fee $197 and graduate fee $279.)  
If you have not been charged the fee, you are not covered by this plan.  
Some students may not qualify to be assessed the fee.  
Necessary forms and instructions for exemption, extension, and dependent 
coverage can be printed off our web site: www.si.uiuc.edu, under 
important forms, bottom of the page.  The deadline is 09/23/08.

to illinois.edu, it is important to note that the campus is not 
relinquishing the rights to the uiuc.edu domain name. Although it is 
critical that we begin using our illinois.edu email addresses and that Web 
sites begin to migrate to illinois.edu, there are several reasons for 
continuing to support the uiuc.edu domain in the coming years:

- There are legacy uiuc.edu addressed print materials still in circulation.
- Converting these legacy links would be extremely costly and time-
consuming. 
- The uiuc.edu name occurs in places over which we have no control. 

Even as we move forward in building the Illinois brand through the 
Illinois Domain Project, we want to make clear that legacy addresses 
linked to historic urls will continue to function.
 
Thank you for your continued efforts to migrate your email and Web 
addresses to illinois.edu. Project manager Michele Raupp is available at 
illinoisdomainproject@illinois.edu to answer any questions about the 
migration.
 
Very truly yours,

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Voicemail system outage, August 8-10, 2008","From the morning of Friday, August 8, 2008, until the evening of Sunday,
August 10, 2008, the campus voicemail system was unavailable. The immediate
consequence of the unexpected outage was that no one could leave messages
during that time period, either to personal voicemail boxes or to an
automated attendant (e.g., the Krannert Art Museum). Any individual with a
personal voicemail account should have received a notice of the outage and
its consequences in his/her voicemail box as of Sunday evening, August 10.

We are pleased to report that the voicemail system is once again
operational. There is the remaining issue that in restoring the system,
voicemail messages received prior to the outage are no longer retrievable
by calling the Message Center  (217-244-0505). A special 800 number has
been set up that will allow those with voicemail accounts to hear the
messages stored in their voicemail boxes as of the morning of August 8,
2008. They will not be able to reply to, resend or store messages via this
special number, so we suggest those listening to messages be prepared to
write down any pertinent information.

We ask that those needing to call the 800 number to hear their messages
first call CITES Communications Customer Service (217-333-1161). We will
share the 800 number and then work with individuals to make their use of
the special number as easy as possible. Because the 800 number provides
somewhat limited access, we ask that those users who do not have an urgent
need to hear their messages delay calling the 800 number to prevent
possible congestion of the system. The 800 number will be available through
Monday, September 8, 2008. 

On behalf of CITES and the CITES Communications Customer Service staff, I
want to thank you for your patience. We are doing everything we can to make
sure that such an outage does not occur again.

at a time when most universities are experiencing drops in their Annual 
Fund donors. Many of those new donors come from right here on campus. As 
you have witnessed the challenges faced by your own departments, many of 
you have given of your time and resources to help make Brilliant Futures a

The University of Illinois Police Department is seeking assistance in 
gaining information surrounding the physical battery and sexually assault 
of a 19 year-old woman on July 13, 2008, some time between 3:00 a.m. and 
4:00 a.m.

On July 13, 2008, police officers responded to a report of a battery and 
sexual assault that occurred in a parking lot in the 1800 block of South 
Lincoln Avenue.  The suspect is described as a white male, age in the 
twenties with short brown hair and no facial hair.   The suspect is 
described as ""tall and lanky"" and having a ""southern accent"".  The 
suspect's vehicle is a grayish green conversion full size van.  The van 
has grey interior seating and drapes in the cabin windows.  University 
police are aggressively working this case and will provide further 
information when available.

The University of Illinois Police Department urges our community to 
contact the Investigation Division at (217) 333-1216 with information 
regarding this crime.  Callers can also remain anonymous by contacting

Safety Tips

*Travel in groups when possible and avoid walking alone.  If you must walk 
alone, inform others of your activities and route of travel.  Do not 
accept rides from strangers.

*Do not let alcohol or other drugs cloud your judgment or reduce your 
reaction time.

*Stay in well-lit or highly traveled areas when walking, particularly at 
night.  Be wary of isolated spots - apartment laundry rooms, underground 
garages, parking lots, offices after business hours.

*Trust your instincts.  If a situation or place makes you feel 
uncomfortable or uneasy, or if you feel you are being followed, go to a 
public building, residence or store and call 911.

*If using a cell phone or listening to a portable music device, be aware 
of surroundings at all times.  Avoid distractions when possible.

*If you are confronted by an offender, pay close attention to physical 
characteristics, i.e., tattoos or markings, height, weight, apparel, 
hair/eye color etc.

*If you are robbed and the offender asks for your purse or backpack, don't 
hand it to them but throw it away from you.  Run in the other direction, 
if possible.

*Use your loudest voice to scream for help, but if there is no one around, 
scream ""NO!"" and hold your hand in a stop position as you are backing away.
 Talk, stall for time, and assess your options.

*Lock the doors and windows to your home or apartment.  Secure all easily 
accessible windows and use peepholes to identify visitors.

The Champaign Police Department is requesting assistance from anyone
knowing the whereabouts of an unknown suspect who is wanted for attempting
to sexually assault a 21 year-old woman on July 6, 2008, sometime around
2:15 a.m.

On July 6, 2008, officers were dispatched to meet a complainant regarding a
battery and attempted sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 500
block of East Healey Street.  The officer was informed that an unknown
suspect came up behind victim in her apartment complex and grabbed her. 
The suspect threatened both bodily and sexual harm to the victim.  The
victim struggled with the suspect and yelled for help, which alerted people
nearby.  The suspect then fled the building and to date has not been
located.  The suspect is described as a Hispanic male, approximately 25
y/o, 5'7"", 160 lbs wearing a white T-shirt with red graffiti and blue jeans.  

The Champaign Police Department is working with the University of Illinois
Police Department to alert students and campus residents of this crime and

Department will continue to work with the Champaign Police Department to

 Subject: MASSMAIL - New Campus Unit Logo Standards","We are stronger when we speak as one.

When the diverse individual parts of our great institution associate their 
unique strengths with those of their peers through a consistent, 
coordinated use of the University's identity, together we increase our 
reputation for excellence and protect the integrity of our academics, 
research, and public engagement missions. 

We have made significant progress toward this goal with the implementation 
of Illinois Identity Standards for Web and print materials, and we now ask 
you to build upon those successes and implement a branding up strategy. 
Branding up means that campus units use the campus logos and refer to 
themselves in text instead of expending resources developing and 
maintaining their own logos and brands. 

In sum, we are asking that all campus units:

- Phase out the use of campus unit logos
- Use the campus logos
- Refer to themselves with text
- Continue to use a comprehensive visual identity that incorporates the 
campus logos

The only exceptions are campus units that are identified as sub-brands, 
independent brands, consortia, and external partnerships. These are 
described and listed in the brand architecture outlined at 
http://www.illinois.edu/goto/brandarc 

An overview of the campus branding strategy and rationale, with links to 
detailed guidelines, is at http://www.illinois.edu/goto/overview. A series 
of workshops about campus branding and the new standards has been 
scheduled over the next several weeks. To view available times and 
register, visit http://www.illinois.edu/goto/iisworkshops 

We thank you for your commitment to this important initiative. We have 
asked Public Affairs to continue to manage the branding effort. Questions

exempt status, look on your e-bill to see if you have been charged the 
UIUC Student Insurance fee (undergrad fee $180.00, graduate fee $256.)  If 
you have not been charged the fee, you are not covered by this plan.  Some

events in the past year have resulted in major changes related to parking.

mandatory subject of bargaining.  As a result of this ruling, the 
University of Illinois has begun to significantly revise its parking 
permit fee structure.  

University representatives began a process of negotiating parking rates 
with unions on each campus.  For the Urbana campus, a number of agreements 
have been reached that feature a sliding scale parking rate, based on the 
annual salary of each employee. Specifically, the parking fees paid by 
these employees will be 0.7% (seven-tenths of one percent) of their annual 
base salary.  Represented employees whose union contracts have not yet 
come up for negotiation will continue to pay the FY08 parking rate of 
$35.58 per month, pursuant to the requirements of Illinois public sector 
labor law.  

Chancellor Richard Herman and Provost Linda Katehi have decided to extend 
the new parking rate structure to all nonrepresented employees on the 
Urbana campus (faculty, academic professionals, and open range civil 
service staff).  Additionally, they have also added a cap to the sliding 
scale structure that will provide an upper limit to the monthly parking 
rate.  For FY09, this cap is $40 per month.  Therefore, beginning July 1, 
2008, all nonrepresented employees on the Urbana campus will be charged 
either:  (a) 0.7% of their annual base salary per month for rental lot 
permits, or (b) the designated cap of $40 per month, whichever is less.  
For most employees, this new fee structure based on a sliding scale 
percentage rate will result in a decrease in their monthly parking fee.  
For the minority of employees who, based on their annual earnings, will 
see an increase in their parking fee, the maximum increase will be $4.42 
per month (i.e., the difference between the cap rate of $40 per month for 
FY09 compared to the FY08 rate of $35.58 per month).

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Office of Sustainability","Dear Members of the Campus Community:

In our 2006 strategic plan, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
defined an ambitious strategic intent to undertake a comprehensive set of
efforts focused on sustainability.  That strategic intent is expressed in
the following paragraph from the campus plan:

""Through the Illinois Sustainable Energy and the Environment Initiative we
will assemble other leading universities, corporations and private
enterprises, and government in the state to develop new technologies,
models, and practices that will shape national policy, promote responsible
stewardship of resources, and build the Sustainable Energy and the
Environment Initiative.  In this initiative, we will both pursue the
discoveries of basic science and seek to understand the social aspects of
life in a complex society, focusing on key areas such as power generation
and networks, transportation and portable energy, water supply and use, and
landscapes and urban architecture. We will transform the campus into a
learning laboratory for demonstration of sustainable technologies while we
develop curricula to prepare students with skills required to tackle the
challenges of a sustainable society.  We will position the state of
Illinois as a recognized leader in research, education, and practices to
promote sustainable utilization of energy, water, and land.""

At the Board of Trustees meeting, May 17, 2007, Lawrence C. Eppley, Chair
of the Board of Trustees stated the ""importance for the University of
Illinois to slow the increase in demand for energy, reduce consumption
where possible, and change business and management  processes in ways that
take energy conservation into account.  He asked the president of the
University and the campus chancellors to recommend a University energy
policy that would position the University as a leader in the State in this
area.""  

At its meeting on November  14, 2007, the Board of Trustees approved a
University Energy Policy calling on the University to ""assume a leadership
role in Illinois and beyond in achieving greater efficiency in energy
production and consumption, in developing renewable energy sources and
reducing greenhouse gas emissions.""  Further, it directed that ""the
University will expand its teaching, research, and public engagement
programs related to energy production and conservation and alternative and
renewable energy sources.""      

Over the past two years, the campus community (students, staff, and
faculty) has fostered an impressive set of activities and programs that
respond to sustainability challenges and opportunities.  A few examples of
these efforts include achieving significant energy savings from
retro-commissioning of key campus buildings, students designing a rain
garden to improve water management in the community, and establishing, in
collaboration with public and private sector partners, the Energy
Biosciences Institute to advance the frontiers of knowledge relating to
bioenergy.  In February, 2008, the campus became a signatory to the
American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment.  	 

The campus activities and programs underway have made important strides
towards achieving the strategic intent of the campus.  Attaining the full
potential of that strategic intent now requires targeted campus-level
organizational support to foster and coordinate growth of campus activities
relating to sustainability.  Therefore, I am establishing two campus
leadership entities, the Campus Sustainability Council and the Office of
Sustainability.  These two entities will operate in an integrated fashion
to provide leadership for the extensive efforts across campus focused on
responding to the societal challenges associated with global climate change
and its potential impacts.  The scope of their activities will be
comprehensive, encompassing not only the academic functions of education,
research, and engagement but also operations of the campus physical
infrastructure.  

The Campus Sustainability Council, which I will chair, will provide
strategic direction and oversight for sustainability initiatives on campus.
 Relative to opportunities and challenges associated with sustainability,
the Council will be responsible for fostering campus initiatives to empower
tomorrow's societal leaders, reengineer the campus infrastructure and
practices, create knowledge and technology, and engage with external
constituents.  The Director of the Office of Sustainability will serve as
Vice Chair of the Council.  Additional members of the Council will include
the Provost, campus Vice Chancellors, the Executive Director of Campus
Facilities and Services, the Executive Director of the Institute for
Natural Sciences and Sustainability, as well as representatives of the
Environmental Council, the Council of Deans, student groups, and the local
community.

The Office of Sustainability will provide operational leadership to campus
sustainability efforts, significantly enhancing communication and
coordination across the relevant campus domains.  The Office will work
with colleges and other campus units, e.g., the Environmental Council and
student groups such as the Students for Environmental Concerns and the
Student Sustainability Council, to develop and promote opportunities for
engaging faculty and students with the critical environmental, social, and
economic issues of sustainability at this time and into the future. 
Initially comprised of a small staff focused on enhancing communications
and coordination of campus activities, the Office of Sustainability will
have reporting responsibilities to the Office of the Vice Chancellor for
Public Engagement.  Because of the broad scope of its activities, however,
the Office of Sustainability will need to maintain strong linkages to the
entire set of campus administrative units.

The Office of Sustainability has lead responsibility for implementation of
the elements of the campus' strategic plan involving sustainability. 
Selected specific activities of the Office of Sustainability include:


* Achieve the responsibilities associated with the American College and
University Presidents Climate Commitment including development of a
comprehensive plan (with a comprehensive inventory within one year and an
institutional action plan within two years) and initiation of action steps
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

* Coordinate actions to enhance campus infrastructure and policies relating
to energy use and sustainability with campus academic functions

* Facilitate curricular enhancements, including incorporation of service
learning opportunities in the community, which better prepare students for
leadership and citizenship as society responds to climate change

* Encourage innovative research collaborations focused on creating
knowledge and technologies which will better enable society to reduce
emissions and achieve climate neutrality

* Foster collaboration with external constituencies, including especially
our local communities, to apply broadly the lessons learned from campus
operations and from our knowledge creation activities

* Provide forums by which the broad cultural, social and technological
dimensions of the campus intellectual capacity can engage in meaningful
dialogue regarding the challenges and opportunities associated with
sustainability.


I look forward to working with you to create a sustainable campus that will
serve as a national model.

Warm regards,

Richard Herman
Chancellor

 Subject: MASSMAIL - illinois.edu e-mail addresses enabled","As we work to build the Illinois brand, one of the biggest challenges we 
face is the continued use of *uiuc* in e-mail addresses and Web site URLs. 
As long as we continue to use this terminology, we lose the impact of 
consistently representing ourselves as Illinois.  

As of May 13, 2008, faculty, staff and students at the Urbana campus are 
able to use NetID@illinois.edu e-mail addresses. E-mail sent to users' 
current addresses at @uiuc.edu will be forwarded automatically to their 
new @illinois.edu addresses. You are encouraged to adopt the new address 
and use it on printed materials, in e-mail signatures, in electronic 
mailing list subscriptions and anywhere else your e-mail address is used.

The use of *uiuc* came about because we were an Internet pioneer. At the 
time, the marketing value of a meaningful domain name was not considered. 
But today, with the widespread use of the Internet, we must use our Web 
address to its full potential, and that includes its use as a branding 
tool.

While this may seem a minor change, Web and e-mail addresses are the 
vehicles through which many audiences recognize the University. 
Additionally, the continued use of *uiuc* has caused division in how 
faculty, staff and students refer to the campus. You are this 
institution's ambassadors to the world. The more consistently we present 
ourselves as *Illinois,* the better we communicate the comprehensive 
excellence of the University and build our reputation as one of the 
world's preeminent research institutions.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Filesharing/P2P Information and Warning","
The end of every academic year can be hectic with finals, graduation, moving out and wrapping 
up loose ends before leaving campus for break. Copyright holders are also staying busy by using 
this time to put in extra effort to track down people that are illegally sharing and downloading 
files online. At the end of every semester, groups like the RIAA dramatically increase the number 
of copyright notifications that they send to the campus to investigate. In the past few days the 
security office has received more copyright infringement notices than it received in the previous 
year. Clearly, the RIAA is watching the University of Illinois network closely right now.

If you are caught downloading or sharing files illegally, not only do you face the very real 
possibility of being sued for thousands of dollars this summer by groups like the RIAA, but your 
connection to the campus network will be immediately shut off. Access may not be restored 
until a formal disciplinary process has been completed. Take a moment to think about your finals 
study schedule and think if you can afford in these final weeks to lose your ability to access your 
email, Illinois Compass and even your ability to surf the web.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Safe and Supportive Environment","As we move toward the end of the semester, the pressure on students 
grows.  We all play important roles in assisting and supporting students.  
We recognize that recent events may raise concerns for students and 
faculty about stress, safety, and preparedness.  With this in mind, we 
would like to remind you of the following campus resources.

First, the Division of Public Safety (9-911 from any campus phone) is the 
contact for any emergency situation or immediate crisis including any 
direct or indirect threatening behavior.  If you are off campus, call 911 
directly.  In a non-emergency, the Division of Public Safety can be 
reached at 333-1216.  Public Safety's website, http://www.dps.uiuc.edu, 
contains safety-related information along with a link to the Office of 
Campus Emergency Planning.  This site will provide you with an overview of 
the security and emergency planning done on campus.  

Second, the campus already has several ways to reach you, including:  
massmail, the campus homepage, a telephone tree, local media, recorded 
messages at 265-UIPD, weather sirens, and loudspeakers in police cars.  We 
are adding several new ways to reach you:  one is a pop-up on campus Web 
pages, another is destination signs on MTD buses/bus stops, and the final 
new method is the emergency messaging system.  The system will send e-mail 
and text message notifications to all users who register their 
information.  We encourage all faculty, staff, and students to register 
their contact information for this system at:  emergency.illinois.edu. 

Third, we are enlisting your help in identifying students who may be 
struggling emotionally, psychologically, or academically. Because you are 
the ?front line? personnel of the University, your connections to the 
students you teach and mentor are critical components of the support the 
University works hard to provide students.  While it is often impossible 
to precisely predict or anticipate acts of violence to self or others, it 
is important to try to be sensitive concerning these possibilities and 
report relevant information to campus police or other resources.

Some of the behavioral signs of psychological crisis or acute distress are 
as follows:

-Sad, anxious, or empty mood
-Expressions of hopelessness or extreme pessimism
-Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, helplessness
-Lost interest or pleasure in hobbies and social activities
-Fatigued or slowed down behavior
-Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
-Problems sleeping, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping
-Appetite or weight changes
-Agitation or irritability
-Social withdrawal
-Diminished hygiene (stops washing hair, bathing, changing clothes)

Other signs that instructors might be especially cognizant of include:

-Diminished class attendance
-Significant decline in academic performance
-Failure to keep appointments with faculty or teaching assistants
-Failure (especially among graduate students) to make satisfactory 
progress in their program of study or to be in contact with their graduate 
advisor
-Difficulty completing or submitting assignments in a timely manner
-Speech that seems disorganized or confusing

While these behavioral markers do not always parallel a psychological 
problem, they may be indicative of someone who is not managing his or her 
life very effectively.  So these types of behaviors may merit follow up 
with the student.  This inquiry might be accomplished by having a 
conversation with the student to see if he or she is feeling in crisis or 
overwhelmed by life demands.

Therefore, we are asking for your help.  We know from national statistics 
that early referral to counseling services for students who are struggling 
psychologically is the best way to treat their problems effectively, and 
we know from studies that effective treatment positively correlates to 
academic persistence and retention.  Our counseling services include a 
suicide prevention program that is nationally recognized.  If you observe 
or believe that one of your students is struggling with psychological 
problems, is in crisis, or is floundering academically, please refer them 
to one of the following resources for help:

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Unofficial St. Patrick's Day","While we know that the majority of students do not participate 
in ""Unofficial St. Patrick's Day"" activities, the students who do 
participate warrant my writing. During Unofficial, the drunken demeanor of 
many students endangers the lives and safety of participants and community 
members and blemishes the reputation of the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign and the surrounding communities.  

The University does not sanction this bar-sponsored commercial event and 
we discourage participation by our students and others.  Excessive 
consumption of alcohol can result in unintended injuries, emergency room 
admissions and deaths.  Last year, over 90 participants went to the 
hospital and two years ago a recent alumna died as a result of an 
Unofficial-related traffic accident. 

We urge all students to take pride in our University community.  Start by 
discouraging your out-of-town friends from coming onto campus to 
participate in this event on Friday, February 29 for the day or the 
weekend.  If you choose to participate, we encourage you to be aware of 
the legal repercussions of violating the law and the Campus Code of 
Conduct. Disrupting classes will not be tolerated.  

Keep in mind the importance of your own health and safety, as well as the 
health and safety of others, and remember, too, that inviting people from 
off-campus to participate in this event only encourages the possibility of 
more health- and safety-related problems.  And finally, don't drink and 
drive or ride with someone who has been drinking, and obey traffic laws 
even when walking.  

Be safe, be smart, and watch out for one another.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Unofficial St. Patrick's Day - February 29","On Friday, February 29, 2008, many Campustown bars will participate in the 
annual business promotion known as Unofficial St. Patrick's Day (USPD). 
While the University does not support or condone this promotion, steps are 
being taken to ensure the safety of students who choose to participate, 
and to insulate academic instruction and campus operations from 
disruption. Last year, disruption of instruction during USPD was minimized 
in part because students understood that academic business would continue 
as usual. We trust that such will be the case again this year.

In the interest of safety, Champaign Police will have a visible presence 
in Campustown on February 29. They will enforce all applicable ordinances 
in commercial areas, and have been given special authority to intervene if 
private parties threaten to disturb the peace. In addition, Champaign city 
officials have enacted special restrictions on liquor sales that are 
intended to curb overconsumption. Given the probable limitations of these 
efforts, emergency medical personnel will stand ready to provide care as 
required.

The profile of the University Police will also be elevated during USPD. 
Their work will focus on protecting students, staff, faculty, and 
University property from harm caused by the disorderly conduct of event 
participants. Report emergencies to METCAD at 911 (or, from a campus 
phone, 9-911). On February 29, requests for non-emergency response by 
University Police should be directed to 333-1216.

A number of resources are in place to help faculty and staff preserve the 
integrity of academic instruction and campus operations on February 29:

-- The Student Code (http://www.uiuc.edu/admin_manual/code/) addresses 
student responsibilities on campus. Sections 1-102(d) and 1-302(f), on 
classroom conduct expectations, and section on 1-307, on alcohol 
consumption, are particularly relevant. The Code empowers instructors to 
ask disruptive students to leave class; after class, names of disruptive 
students should be reported to the Office for Student Conflict Resolution 
at 333-3680 or via online form at 
http://www.conflictresolution.uiuc.edu/forms/incidentReport/form.asp.

-- If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into 
confrontation, it will be best to avoid confrontation and seek assistance. 
From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on February 29, teams of Student Affairs and 
Academic Affairs staff will walk through and around buildings with 
classrooms and lecture halls where disruptions were experienced in 2006. 
Roaming team members, wearing their University IDs as nametags and 
identified as university officials, may be summoned to assess problematic 
situations. Teams will be prepared to document apparent Code violations 
and to call University Police if necessary. Of course, instructors and 
students are encouraged to report emergencies directly to METCAD at 911 
(or, from a campus phone, 9-911).

-- Students will be asked to surrender liquids prior to entering the two 
largest lecture halls on the Quad (Foellinger Auditorium and Lincoln Hall 
Theater). This represents enforcement of standing policies that prohibit 
food and beverages in these venues.

Students should understand that those who choose to interfere with the 
academic mission of the University will face serious consequences. 
Instructional and support staff are thanked for joining the effort to 
reinforce this message before and on February 29.

To:  		University of Illinois Community
From: 		President B. Joseph White
Subject:  	Resources Initiative

In December 2007, following discussions with the chancellors, I 
convened a university-wide resources summit attended by 125 
leaders representing the three campuses, university administration 
and the foundation and alumni association.  The summit was designed 
to open dialogue on how we can deliver maximum resources to the 
academic front lines: faculty positions and salaries and financial 
support of our core academic missions of teaching, research, service 
and economic development. 

This is an important initiative because while the university's rate 
of total revenue growth has been quite strong over the past three 
years, the demands on these revenues to fund utilities, deferred 
maintenance, staff growth and other areas have been substantial. 

Looking ahead, we do not expect the university's rate of revenue 
growth to increase significantly in the near future.

Therefore I decided, in consultation with the chancellors, to 
launch an important new resources initiative for the university at 
the summit.  The purpose of the initiative is to focus our 
resources to the fullest extent possible on our core academic 
missions and the faculty, staff and students who are integral to 
their success.  The chancellors and I have encountered widespread 
concerns about resource adequacy among some of our academic 
colleagues, despite our relatively strong financial situation.  
The resources initiative will help us address those concerns.  

Stated differently, I believe that for the amount of incremental 
revenue we are earning each year as a university, not enough of it 
is reaching the academic front lines.    

The resources summit began a collective and open dialogue on these 
important and difficult matters.  In this letter, I want to 
provide the university community with an overview of the summit 
and describe the next steps of the resources initiative.  

REVIEW OF THE RESOURCES SUMMIT
The chancellors and provosts of the three campuses and the vice 
presidents of finance and academic affairs assisted me in 
developing the list of attendees which included deans, 
representatives of the faculty, the campus senates, the senates 
conference, a student leader from each campus and senior 
administrators.  Prior to the meeting the participants were 
provided with a case study of the university's current resources 
picture, including questions like these:

* How can we reduce the growth of central costs at all levels-- 
  university administration, campuses, colleges/schools and departments?  

* Are we trying to support ""too much university"" with the dollars we 
  have?  How can we collectively examine the scope of academic 
  offerings and units at each campus to improve quality and free up 
  resources for faculty, academic programs and student support? 

* How can the president and vice presidents, chancellors, provosts, 
  deans and faculty best collaborate to undertake this initiative in 
  a way that will yield meaningful and constructive results?


Chief Financial Officer Walter Knorr provided the summit participants 
with an overview of university revenues and expenditures.  The provosts 
provided examples of how they handle resource challenges on their 
campuses.  

The deliberations of discussion groups and a summary of the summit 
were posted on an interactive website where the participants 
provided feedback.  That feedback included many good ideas.  All 
this information is now available at: 

http://www.uillinois.edu/president/ResourcesSummitDocuments.cfm

At the end of the summit, I told the participants that as we 
strive to manage our resources more effectively, I am passionately 
committed to:  

* Strengthening the quality, academic environment and reputation of 
  the University of Illinois.

* Making and encouraging fundamental change to achieve these goals. 

NEXT STEPS
The summit initiated constructive dialogue necessary for change. 
Participants stressed transparency and collaboration at all levels 
as we move forward with resource planning.  This communication is 
part of the collaborative effort.

We will pursue a two-pronged approach, long-term and short-term, 
so as not to lose momentum.  

Long-Term Plans: We will develop a five-year view of our resource 
future so we can capitalize on resource opportunities that require 
more than a single year to plan and execute.  

* We will develop a five-year projection of annual operating budgets 
  and a five-year capital plan (our long-range plans).

* We will streamline our central organizations through careful 
  planning and attrition.

* We will be good stewards of the environment and achieve cost 
  containment through leadership in energy production efficiency and 
  energy conservation.   

* We will maintain high quality academic programs and avoid sprawl and 
  mediocrity by regularly and rigorously reviewing all academic programs.  

* We will seek change in externally imposed regulatory requirements 
  and procedures that are incompatible with cost effectiveness and 
  the university's mission and culture.

Short-Term Actions: A number of ideas suggested at the summit can 
be implemented in a relatively short period of time. 

* We will ensure that every faculty member has access to proper 
  financial support in pursuing her/his teaching, research and 
  professional development. 

* We will take immediate steps to accelerate energy conservation such 
  as changing to more energy-efficient lighting and inviting members 
  of our community to identify and innovate ways to conserve energy. 

* We will develop service centers to support aggregations of small 
  departments where this makes sense.  

* We will join together to reduce bureaucratic waste and resulting 
  frustration.  

Resources Steering Group: With the chancellors' concurrence, I am 
forming a university-wide resources steering group comprised of 
the three provosts and the three vice presidents to help guide the 
resources initiative.  This group will charge campus-level working 
groups, convened by the provosts, to address issues at each campus.  
A fourth working group will be in university administration.  The 
working groups will meet and report regularly to the steering group.  
The steering group, chancellors and I will work together to ensure 
that the changes will focus our resources and strengthen the quality 
and reputation of the university.   

In summary, the goal of the resources initiative is to operate the 
university in a way that delivers the most resources possible to 
the academic front lines.  Dialogue is central to the success of 
this initiative.  I welcome your insights and involvement.  The 
chancellors and I will keep you updated on progress.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Rock the Vote!","Dear Friends:
It has often been said that silence is permission. In the United States,
that silence too often takes the form of disinterest, cynicism, and apathy
among voters. Yet, democracy can only function with active participation by
its citizens. 

Super Tuesday is an opportunity to participate in one of democracy's most
hallowed rights. That it why I am urging all of you in the university
community to make your voice heard loud and clear, to Rock the Vote right
here at the University of Illinois.

Reasons to vote are as varied as the many critical issues we face as a
nation, a state, and as a land grant university. President Lyndon Johnson
said, ""The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for
breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison
men because they are different from other men."" Want your voice heard on
global warming, poverty, campaign financing, heath care, or Darfur? Give
voice to those issues by voting for the candidate that comes closest to
your point of view. 

Most importantly, with your single vote you reject the all too easy path of
apathy and cynicism. You are saying that you believe in the power of people
to effect change and that you will not be silent.

Here at Illinois we are one campus with many voices. Tomorrow, let yours be
heard.

Richard Herman
Chancellor

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Winter Storm Preparations","     A Winter Storm Warning has been issued for most of Central Illinois,
including the Champaign-Urbana area, with snow totals potentially
reaching ten inches by Friday afternoon. In anticipation of this event,
Facilities & Services' Maintenance Division is making preparations to
address concerns and conditions resulting from the storm.
     Streets and sidewalks are being pre-treated today to facilitate
faster snow and ice removal. The Campus Emergency Response team is
monitoring the situation. Crews are preparing for around-the-clock
coverage. Maintenance resources will be deployed as quickly as possible
to begin work on priority areas. 
     Primary campus streets and drives are the number one priority for
the large snow plows; sidewalks and building entrances are first
priorities for the grounds and building services departments. Large
parking lots will be cleared first. If your lot has not been plowed when
you report to work, proceed to E14 on south campus or B1 on north campus. 
If those lots should be full you may park in any parking garage  MTD will 
continue its shuttle routes to and from the E14 lot (west of the Assembly 
Hall). Vehicles parking in lots with permits for other areas will not be 
cited for violations; however, enforcement will continue for violations 
such as parking in handicapped spaces, yellow zones, or blocking
driveways.
     Moving cars off the street tonight will expedite efforts; fewer
vehicles in the parking lots and on the streets will allow for more
efficient snow removal. A list of campus snow removal priorities is
posted on our website (http:\\www.fs.uiuc.edu), but is subject to change 
depending on conditions and emergency situations.
     The Maintenance Division is responsible for providing snow and ice
removal on 23 miles of roadway, 130 parking lots with 16,000 spaces, 80
miles of sidewalk, 6 miles of bike lane and over two hundred and fifty
buildings on 1400 acres.  Snow removal after a major storm event,
especially when high winds are involved, can be daunting and time
consuming. Final completion of the effort can take several days.  We
appreciate your patience and cooperation in anticipation of this winter
storm.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Enhancing the Work Environment at Illinois","Here at Illinois, we are devoted to creating an environment that is 
inclusive and free from all forms of discrimination and harassment. This 
is a critical priority for the University and is prominently reflected in 
the Campus Strategic Plan and the Chancellor's Diversity Initiatives 
Committee's Report.

In support of this effort, the Inclusive Illinois initiative began in 
August, 2007, and continues to foster respectful living, learning, and 
working environments through awareness and education. I am personally 
seeking your assistance to ensure that all employees receive 
multicultural, discrimination, and harassment awareness training. These 
seminars are important for two primary reasons.  First, we want our 
faculty and staff to be informed.  Second, there is a need for dialogue in 
order to better understand the issues that we face, as well as the tools 
needed to navigate and address these issues. Also, when an employer 
provides in-house training to employees on multicultural, discrimination, 
and harassment awareness, the individual and institutional liability are 
substantially reduced. 

Dr. Larine Cowan, Assistant Chancellor and Director of the Office of Equal 
Opportunity and Access (OEOA), has scheduled a series of seminars and 
workshops. They will take place February 11 through April 25, and will 
last one hour. Our goal is that all employees will attend the training. 
This is an approved event and employees should be given release time to 
attend these sessions. In addition, managers and supervisors will have the 
opportunity to attend 90-minute sessions, which also include disability 
accommodation procedures.

It is a good idea for each one of us to renew our commitment to the 
highest standards of conduct and to the values of inclusivity and 
diversity. Your units and staff members are encouraged to make their 
pledge to the Commitment Statement at 
http://www.inclusiveillinois.uiuc.edu/InclusiveCommit.html.

sports program.  The Board is also responsible for that program as it 
relates to the academic and educational objectives defined by the Senate.

The Committee on Committees is seeking nominations from qualified faculty

slate, the Chancellor will appoint one of these nominees.

We invite you to make nominations; faculty may also self-nominate.

We want to remind the campus community of two attempted sexual assaults
that took place shortly before and during winter break, and we ask your
help in finding the suspect or suspects.

University of Illinois police are investigating the incident that occurred
Dec. 14 at about 5:30 p.m. A female student observed a suspicious person on
the southeast side of the Illini Union, who began to follow her as she
entered the Union. The student entered the Union briefly, and, upon
exiting, was grabbed around the neck by the suspect near the south side of
Harker Hall. The victim struggled with the suspect, whom she described as a
black man, about 5 feet 9 inches tall, with a large build, wearing a black
baseball cap (possibly with a New York Yankees logo), zippered black jacket
with white lining, and light blue baggy jeans.

During the struggle, the suspect told the victim he had a gun, and forcibly
took the victim to the east side of Noyes Lab. The victim was able to dial 
911, and before the suspect was able to assault her further, a witness
passed by and yelled at the suspect, who fled.

Photographs of the suspect were captured by security cameras in the Union.
The photographs, personal safety tips and information about the incident
are available on the Division of Public Safety's Web site at
http://www.dps.uiuc.edu/campusalert.htm.

Champaign police are investigating an attempted sexual assault that
occurred on Jan. 7 at about 9:40 p.m. A woman was walking in the 600 block
of West Washington Street when she was grabbed from behind. The suspect,
armed with a knife, dragged the victim to a residential yard. The victim
struggled with the suspect, whom she described as a black man, about 5 feet
10 inches tall and weighing about 170 pounds.

The victim was able to scream during the struggle, alerting a resident in
the area. The suspect then fled.

University police are working with Champaign police to determine if the
incidents are related.

Both police departments are asking anyone with information regarding these
crimes to get in touch with the U. of I. police at 333-1216 or the
Champaign police at 351-4545. Information can be reported anonymously to
Crimestoppers at 373-8477. Anonymous tips can also be reported on the
Crimestoppers Web site: http://www.champaigncountycrimestoppers.com.

The police remind everyone to continue safe practices such as being aware
of your surroundings and calling 911 (or 9-911 from a campus phone) to
report any suspicious behavior.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Public Safety Bulletin - Attempted Sexual Assault","Dear Members of the Campus Community,

In the interest of safety awareness on campus during the winter break 
period, we wish to inform our community of an attempted sexual assault 
incident.

University of Illinois police are investigating an attempted sexual 
assault that occurred on Friday, December 14, 2007, at about 5:30 p.m.  A 
female student observed a person on the southeast side of the Illini Union 
who appeared to be hiding in the shadows.  The student entered the Union 
briefly, and upon exiting the building was grabbed around the neck by the 
suspect near the south side of Harker Hall.  The victim struggled with the 
suspect, whom she described as a black man, about 5 feet 9 inches tall, 
with a large build, wearing a black baseball cap (possibly with a New York 
Yankees logo), zippered white jacket with a black design, and light blue 
baggy jeans.

During the struggle, the suspect forcibly took the victim to the east side 
of Noyes Lab.  The victim told police she believed the suspect had a gun. 
The victim was able to dial 911, and before the suspect was able to 
assault her further, a witness passed by and yelled at the suspect, who 
fled.

Photographs of the suspect were captured by security cameras in the Union 
and can be viewed off of the Division of Public Safety's Website at 
http://www.dps.uiuc.edu/campusalert.htm.

U. of I. police are aggressively working this case and seeking assistance 
from the community.  Anyone with information regarding this crime should 
call the U. of I. police at 333-1216.  Those wishing to report information 
anonymously can call Crimestoppers at 373-TIPS.

Those on campus during the break are encouraged to continue safe practices 
such as being aware of your surroundings and contacting 911 (or 9-911 from 
a campus phone) to report any suspicious behavior.

During this year's semester break, it is especially important that all 
faculty, staff, and students turn off as much energy-using equipment as 
possible.  With your help, during this extended time of minimal occupancy, 
we can achieve savings of $150,000 to $300,000.  The list of recommended 
actions includes:

Assure that all windows and doors are closed tightly and locked

Turn off all lights, including under cabinet and task lighting

Turn off or unplug office equipment, such as copy machines, small fans, 
coffee makers, etc. 

Set thermostats at 55 to 60 degrees (excluding special research needs and 
animal rooms)
 
For monitors, printers, and other peripherals:  Turn off unless needed for 
remote access over the break.   Also see CITES energy recommendations 
at http://www.cites.uiuc.edu/guidelines/energy.html  

For workstations: If you do not have direction from the IT professionals 
who support your unit, ask them if it is safe to power off workstations 
during the break period.  Please do so if at all possible.  

Turn off fume hoods with start/stop controls wherever possible; fully 
lower the sash on all other hoods

benefit both campus utility budgets and the environment.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - SSN Elimination Program Information","Recently Chancellor Herman announced to deans, directors, and department
heads an SSN elimination program at the Urbana campus. This program
requires all faculty and staff to search for and eliminate, redact, or
securely archive electronic files containing Social Security numbers from
their workstations. This memo provides some additional information and
guidance to assist in this process.

There are three points that address the most commonly asked questions in
relation to the program.

*Why is it necessary to do this?
Historically SSNs were used as the primary ID for individuals (faculty,
staff, and students) on reports, class rosters, and administrative
documents. Consequently many faculty and staff retain these older documents
on their workstations. Eliminating these files (or at a minimum the SSNs in
them) significantly lowers the risk to individuals from unwarranted
disclosure. 

*How do I do this?
The Program asks you to search for these historical files. Even though you
may not realize it, you may store older files on your workstation. The
Security Office has created a program, Firefly, to help with this process.
Firefly will give you a list of files it believes contains SSNs and links
to those files. Firefly will *not* remove files or SSNs from your computer.
It is not a perfect solution: occasionally it will miss a file, and it will
flag some files incorrectly (false positives). The IT Professionals in your
unit can help you with technical issues related to using Firefly and the
CITES Help Desk is prepared to answer more general usage questions as well.
If you're a Windows user please use Internet Explorer and visit
http://firefly.uiuc.edu for an automated installation. Mac users can use
any browser to visit the same URL where you will be able to download a Mac
specific version. 
The deadline for completion is Jan. 14, 2008.

*Firefly is reporting lots of files, many of which do not have SSNs; is
something wrong?
No, Firefly has a lower false positive rate than any other tool we
evaluated. It is impossible in some circumstances to separate a random
9-digit number from an SSN, particularly when there are thousands of files
to scan. Please use common sense and experience to ignore obvious false
positives. Note that large drives or older machines may require several
hours or overnight to fully scan the files.

Full documentation for the SSN Program can be found at

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Security Announcement regarding Pakistan","Dear Colleagues,

I write to inform you of the position of the University of Illinois on the
current situation in Pakistan.  As you may know, Pakistan has experienced
sporadic violence and instability for several years.  Pakistan has been
under a U.S. State Department Warning for two years, the most recent of
which was updated in September, 2007.  Over the past six months or so, the
situation in Pakistan has worsened considerably.  Most recently, after
multiple, horrific bombings upon the return of former Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf declared a state of
emergency and suspended the constitution.  

It is our opinion that conditions are no longer secure or stable enough to
allow for the safety and well-being of our faculty, staff or students in
Pakistan.  As such, I am saddened to announce the suspension of all
University of Illinois sponsored activities in Pakistan which require our
people to be in-country.  No new grants or initiatives which involve
Illinois faculty, staff, students or individuals otherwise affiliated with
the university will be approved or authorized.  Existing initiatives should
be suspended and individuals currently in Pakistan should be strongly
encouraged to return home.  

Faculty, staff, or otherwise affiliated individuals who insist on traveling
to or remaining in Pakistan must acknowledge that they are doing so without
the approval of the University of Illinois, as well as accepting the risks
to their person that are posed by traveling to or remaining in Pakistan. 
These individuals must contact the Office of the Associate Provost for
International Affairs in advance of any travel to Pakistan, or if they have
decided to remain in country.

This decision is a difficult one for me to take and I regret that the
situation on the ground in Pakistan makes it necessary.  However, the
safety and security of our faculty, staff and students must always come
first.  We hope that the situation improves quickly and that activities can
be resumed at an early future date.

If you have any questions, please contact the Office of the Associate
Provost for International Affairs.

Kindest regards,
William I. Brustein

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Town Hall Meeting ","In keeping with the spirit of Inclusive Illinois, Student Affairs is 
hosting a Town Hall Meeting on Tuesday, October 23 from 7 to 8:30 p.m. in 
the Courtyard Cafe of the Illini Union. The purpose of this Town Hall 
Meeting is to examine stereotype themed parties, racial epithets and hate 
speech in the context of our institutional values and the First 
Amendment.  The program will include insights from expert panelists as 
well as open discussion about questions such as:  Why do stereotype themed 
parties and other intolerant behavior occur at UIUC?  What is their impact 
on our community?  What can the administration do in response?  What can 
students do? 
 
These types of incidents are antithetical to the values of the University 
of Illinois and thwart our efforts to create and maintain a safe and 
welcoming campus for all students, faculty and staff.  To fully embrace 
the vision for an Inclusive Illinois, we must address these issues within 
our community.  I hope you will consider attending this event and being a

Dear Colleagues,

In order to raise the visibility of what the Senate does here at UIUC, we 
have begun videorecording and televising our meetings. The October 1st 
meeting will be shown on local access television (channel 7) on Thursday, 
October 4 at 7:00pm.

The main issue of discussion was the Academy on Capitalism and Limited 
Government Fund, which has been in the news lately. There was a thoughtful 
and informative discussion with the Chancellor about this initiative, and 
for those of you wanting to know more about it, this is a great 
opportunity.

The occasion of the discussion was a resolution proposed by Professor 
Belden Fields. In the end, the Senate chose to take the resolution under 
advisement until the next Senate meeting, partly because members were only 
seeing it for the first time. So the conversation will continue.

This is a very important debate for our campus, and accurate information 
about it has been difficult to come by. I urge you to take this 
opportunity to see what the Senate is saying about the issue.

September 19, 2007

Dear Colleague,

The Bylaws of the Senate, Part A 6., state: The Senate shall call an 
annual meeting of the faculty of the campus to hear reports from and to 
question the Senate Executive Committee and the administration.

This year, the Annual Faculty Meeting will be held Monday, September 24, 
at 3:10pm on the 3rd Floor of the Levis Faculty Center.  You will have a 
unique opportunity not only to hear from three key university and campus 
administrators but also to talk with them, both in a discussion period 
during the meeting itself and informally afterward.

President Joseph White, Chancellor Richard Herman, and Provost Linda 
Katehi will deliver remarks, after which there will be an open discussion 
session during which your questions and comments will be welcome.  The 
speakers will give you their sense of where we stand, what we are up 
against, and what is to be done; and they will be interested in hearing 
from you, both on the matters they mention and on others.

We hope that you will join us at the meeting this year.  After its

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Research Integrity Policies - Fall 2007","TO:  Faculty, staff, and students who conduct research
 
FROM:  Charles F. Zukoski, Vice Chancellor for Research
 
For compliance purposes, federal and state sponsors of research require 
that all faculty, staff, and students engaged in sponsored research be 
informed regularly about campus policies on research integrity.

The University-wide procedures for addressing particular instances of 
unethical conduct in research and publication are stated in the pamphlet 
Policy and Procedures on Academic Integrity in Research and Publication. 
This document is available on the Web at: 

         http://www.vpaa.uillinois.edu/policies/ai_toc.asp?bch=0
 
Under this policy, all members of the University community are expected to 
observe high standards of academic integrity and ethical behavior in 
research and publication.  Any practice or conduct by a member of the 
University community that seriously deviates from those ethical standards 
for proposing, conducting, and publishing research that are commonly 
accepted within the professional community constitutes academic misconduct 
in violation of University policy.
 
Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to:
 
   a. Fabrication or falsification of data, including intentionally 
misleading, selective, or deliberately false reporting of credentials or 
other academically related information;
   b. Unacknowledged appropriation of the work of others, including 
plagiarism, the abuse of confidentiality with respect to unpublished 
materials, or misappropriation of physical materials;
   c. Evasion of or intentional failure after notice by the University or 
federal, state, or another appropriate agency to comply with research 
regulations or requirements, including but not limited to those applying
to human subjects, laboratory animals, new drugs, radioactive materials, 
genetically altered organisms, and to safety; and
   d. Other conduct which seriously deviates from accepted ethical 
standards in scholarship.
 
Differences of interpretation or judgment or honest error do not 
constitute academic misconduct.
 
A student or faculty member who believes that academic misconduct has 
occurred has several options for pursuing the matter informally.  Most 
such problems can and should be resolved without resort to formal 
procedures, through consultation with an adviser, department or unit head, 
or the campus Research Standards Officer, Howard Guenther, Associate Vice 
Chancellor for Research.
 
The official campus statement on ""Responsible Professional Conduct:  
Guidelines for Teaching, Research, and Service"" is printed in the ACADEMIC 
STAFF HANDBOOK, available on the Web at:

The guidelines are also printed in the HANDBOOK FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS AND
ADVISORS, available on the Web at:

 Subject: MASSMAIL - FY2008 Budget Summary","Dear Colleagues,

	I write to inform you that the state of Illinois 2008 budget 
appropriation for the University of Illinois is final and that for the 
second consecutive year the University will receive an increase in its 
base state revenue. The increase totals $13.3 million, or 1.9%, and brings 
the University's total general revenue fund appropriation to $722.3 
million (including legislative initiatives) for fiscal year 2008, which 
began on July 1.   

	Having our state appropriation finalized after an historic budget 
legislative session provides the University with certainty now about state 
funding for fiscal 2008 and allows us to move forward with a salary 
program, which I have authorized. 

	In addition to the base appropriation, the state will contribute 
an estimated $441 million in fiscal 2008 to U. of I. faculty and staff 
pensions and health care, bringing the state's total assistance to $1.16 
billion of the University's $3.9 billion annual budget. Additional details 
about the U. of I. budget can be found at  
        http://www.uillinois.edu/our/news/2008Budget.cfm.

	It is a relief to have this vital piece of the University's total 
resources equation in place as we begin the new academic year on our three 
campuses. Thank you for your patience and, as always, for your good work 
and dedication on behalf of the University of Illinois. And best wishes

 Subject: MASSMAIL - One Campus Initiative","Dear Members of the Campus Community,

At Monday's New Student Convocation, I announced the launch of our ""One 
Campus Initiative.""  During this academic year, we will be 
making ""difference"" the topic of our wide-ranging conversation.  The 
initiative began on campus last year with a challenge:  How can we here at 
Illinois appreciate difference in order to make a difference?  

We are more diverse than ever before.  But we still struggle to appreciate 
just what that rich diversity really means, what it requires of us, and 
how we all benefit from embracing an inclusive society.  I am more 
determined than ever to help us get there, because I see how such 
understanding enriches us all.  

We are One Campus, Many Voices.  On the Illinois campus we have students 
from every state in the nation and from 121 countries.  From Alabama to 
Washington; from Albania to Zambia. 

Here we welcome the individual.  Here we respect differences.  Diverse 
perspectives elevate us because they are informed and distinguished by 
race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, ability, class and 
nationality.  Here we practice the idea that every human life from every 
single country has equal value.  Here we can have that crucial 
conversation that begins with the simple question:  I want to know how you 
see the world? 

We believe that you don't create community by erasing conflict.  Instead, 
we believe this is where we push beyond boundaries.  We do not run from 
controversy.  But we must become more practiced at moving toward consensus.
 
As part of our One Campus effort, a new Inclusive Illinois campaign will 
carry us in the right direction--increasing awareness of rights and 
responsibilities across campus.  Many of you already have seen the 
compelling posters in the residence halls--posters that, in words and in 
pictures, speak to the ideal we envision, and set the stage for programs 
to be sponsored across campus this year.  We also will be extending our 
support and encouragement for the many enlightening and elevating events 
and activities developed by academic and cultural units, and registered 
student organizations--events that help us gain a deeper and more 
meaningful understanding of each other.  We encourage you to look for 
updated information on these activities and events, which we will make 
available to you at www.inclusiveillinois.uiuc.edu.

Additionally, there will be the Chancellor's Series on Critical 
Contemporary Issues with plans under way for a key lecture and forum to 
help us further explore the issue of difference--its historical roots and 
its lingering consequences.   

Our hope is to produce an ongoing dialogue.  We want to move toward 
reaching our most important goal--demonstrating Illinois leadership.  I 
think we have the opportunity to orchestrate something at Illinois that 
will resonate throughout the state and the nation.  

This campaign begins with you and with your willingness to embark with us 
on this remarkable journey.  One Campus, Many Voices.  Let yours be heard.

Very truly yours,

Richard Herman

	URBANA--University of Illinois Vice President and Chief Financial 
Officer Walter Knorr said Wednesday that even without a state budget, the 
University remains open for business and all operations are expected to 
continue as usual for the immediate future.

	""The University understands that important decisions are being 
made in Springfield,"" said Knorr. ""We are optimistic that a state budget 
resolution will be forthcoming soon. Meantime, it is business as usual 
across our three campuses and central administration as we prepare to 
begin the new academic year.""

	The University has sufficient resources to sustain operations and 
payroll for the month of August, and the payroll and other essential bills 
will be paid, according to Knorr.

	On Tuesday, University of Illinois President B. Joseph White asked 
staff members in an email message to report to work as usual despite 
uncertainty about the state's budget situation. White expressed confidence 
that the state's leadership would reach resolution on a fiscal 2008 
budget. The state had been operating on a temporary one-month budget, 
which included higher education, since fiscal 2007 ended on June 30.

	Also on Tuesday, Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich issued a 
statement to state employees asking for cooperation to avoid a shutdown in 
government services on August 1 by reporting to work. The letter, posted 
to the governor's website, also told employees that he wants to ""make sure 
you are paid for the work that you do."" The full text is available at:

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Addendum to Publication Agreements for CIC Authors","Dear Colleague,

New opportunities created by electronic publishing and archiving are 
changing the business of scholarly publication.  Because traditional 
publication agreements transfer copyrights to publishers and restrict 
electronic distribution by the author and their institution, publishers 
appear to have captured much of the benefit of these changes.

In November 2006, faculty governance leaders from CIC universities 
discussed these issues that affect scholarly communication and called for 
a concrete strategy that would help faculty retain more control over their 
published intellectual property.  Subsequently, the CIC provosts issued a 
Statement on Publishing Agreements and an Addendum to Publication 
Agreements for CIC Authors.  
(http://www.cic.uiuc.edu/programs/CenterForLibraryInitiatives/Archive/Repor
t/CICAuthRtsFINAL16May07.pdf)   The Addendum is intended to be used by 
faculty entering into publication agreements with journal publishers or 
presses.  It supports authors rights to use their own published work in 
teaching and research, to post a publication on a personal website, or to 
deposit it in a repository maintained by their institution or a 
professional association.  IDEALS (www.ideals.uiuc.edu) is the University 
of Illinois institutional repository.

Late this Spring, the U of I Senate endorsed the principles expressed in 
the CIC Provosts Statement and Addendum; encouraged faculty to consider 
using it as well as other publication agreement addenda that increase 
their rights in reproducing, distributing, and archiving their own work; 
and asked the CIC Provosts to provide leadership in negotiating with 
publishers to develop new publication agreements that provide CIC authors 
and institutions greater rights for use, distribution and archiving their 
published scholarly works.

It is our responsibility as scholars to ensure that our work is available 
as widely as possible to maximize its scholarly impact, accessibility, and 
educational use. I encourage you to use the Addendum and to deposit your 
research and scholarship in IDEALS, which provides reliable and persistent 
access to its holdings.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - CIC Announces Digitization Partnership","To the campus community:

Today the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC), a consortium of 12 
world-class research universities, advancing their missions by sharing 
expertise, leveraging campus resources and collaborating on innovative 
programs, is announcing an agreement with Google to digitize distinctive 
collections across all its libraries as part of the Google Book Search 
project.  As a member of the consortium, our university is part of this 
important initiative.

Over the next several years, Google will scan and make searchable up to 10 
million public domain and in-copyright volumes in a way that is consistent 
with copyright law.  Public domain materials can be viewed, searched and 
downloaded in their entirety.  For books under copyright protection, a 
search will result in basic information (such as the book's title and the 
author's name), and a snippet of text surrounding the search term.  Users 
seeking further information from the text will be directed to avenues for 
purchase or library access.  

Also, this agreement anticipates the CIC's intention to create a shared 
digital repository, so that each university can ""deposit"" its digitized 
public domain files into a commonly funded and managed data storage 
system.  Over time, the shared digital repository will enable our 
librarians to archive and organize content collectively for scholarly 
activity, as well as design services such as customized searches for the 
academic community. When implemented, students and faculty will have 
convenient, desktop access to a vast array of public domain materials from 
across our 12 institutions.

The role of archiving and preserving the vast spectrum of written 
materials is a critical one for university libraries. Many works become 
out of print, or deteriorate with age, or are threatened by natural 
disasters or societal upheavals through the centuries. And as we move to a 
completely technological and digital environment, materials not available 
in a digital format will become less and less discoverable.  Digitization 
enables us to preserve our historical collections for all time.  

This partnership with Google will enable the CIC universities to digitize 
library content at a scale and scope not possible with the limited means 
available to individual institutions.  And now, with the future promise of 
a shared digital repository, our universities will enter into an 
ambitious, groundbreaking collaboration to collectively archive digital 
public domain materials previously housed within the bricks and mortar of 
individual libraries.

Last Friday we announced the ""Brilliant Futures"" campaign with the goal of 
raising $1.5 billion for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 
part of a $2.25 billion University campaign. That's an ambitious goal, but 
it's for a great cause: you and your students. 

We have built campaign goals on the programs and initiatives articulated 
in the Strategic Plan, so every dollar raised in this effort will allow us 
to move closer to our goal of national pre-eminence. Our plan is to raise 
$525 million for support of research and programs, $300 million for chairs 
and professorships, $175 million for scholarships, $135 million for 
fellowships, and $365 million to enhance your work environment (e.g., 
facilities, equipment, library materials).

In the quiet phase of our campaign, which ran from July 1, 2003 through 
May 31, 2007, we raised over $800 million or 53.3% of our campus goal. 
Those contributions were made because our alumni and friends believe in 
the importance of the work you are doing. They feel strongly, as do I, 
that you are changing the world. They contribute because they want to play 
a role in our success.

The next five years will be critical to our shared legacy. 

The sole goal of the campaign is to build the support you need to do the 
bold, innovative, creative work for which Illinois faculty and staff are 
known. But we won't succeed without everyone's help. To build excitement 
about investing in Illinois, it is critical that each of us takes every 
opportunity to share our enthusiasm for this amazing institution. By 
reinforcing your belief in Illinois with your constituents, you are 
helping build their interest and enthusiasm to partner with and support 
your achievements. 

We all are members of the Advancement team, and knowing that makes me 
supremely confident in our ability to recognize our goal of national pre-

I look forward to working together to share many successes.

students, faculty, and staff on Monday, May 14, 2007.  The design 
changes, both aesthetic and functional, will better serve the needs of 
cardholders and card service providers.

i-cards with the current design are still valid. As each campus adopts 
the new i-card design, both current and new i-cards will be in 
circulation and both will continue to be accepted as valid for University 
services. Recarding efforts are being planned to meet the needs of each 
campus and will be communicated as they are finalized. i-card Programs 
will notify campus units before any i-card design is officially retired 
and deactivated, which is not expected to occur before 2009.

Only i-card designs were changed. Visitor cards, University High School 
cards, conference cards, departmental name badges, and other University 
of Illinois IDs are not changing.

The i-card website (www.icard.uillinois.edu) contains a great deal of

On June 1, the University of Illinois, its three campuses in Chicago, 
Springfield and Urbana-Champaign, and the University of Illinois 
Foundation will formally announce the most ambitious fund-raising effort 
in our University's history and one of the largest in the nation.

The greatness of an institution or enterprise resides in its people, their 
intelligence, ambition and motivation. That is certainly true here at the 
University of Illinois. So it is appropriate that the goal of our campaign 
is to provide the U of I family with more opportunity and more resources. 

I think of our University mission in terms of excellence and access. Our 
campaign will increase faculty support and our number of endowed 
professorships. I understand that in today's competitive world of higher 
education, endowed support of professors can mean the difference in 
attracting and retaining brilliant researchers, great teachers and valued 
colleagues. 

With this campaign, we will also raise funds for more student scholarships 
to open our doors more widely to bright students who need financial 
assistance. Once students get here, more resources will allow us to 
enhance their education with the latest classroom technology and more 
opportunities for international-education experiences. 

We are a consequential institution in the history and life of the state, 
nation and world. We have high-aspiration strategic plans for the 
University and our campuses, as well as for every school and college. The 
purpose of the upcoming campaign is to ensure we have the resources to 
turn our plans into reality. 

So please join me in support of our campaign. The University of Illinois 
is a great and distinguished institution. The success of this campaign 
will make it even better.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Energy Consumption","We're all aware that energy costs are a growing part of our personal 
budgets.  It is no different for the University.  Each dollar we spend on 
energy is a dollar not available for salaries, instruction, or basic 
supplies. As we look to the future we must find better ways to control 
energy consumption and costs on campus.

With that in mind, I want to make you aware of some of the current 
initiatives being taken to make the campus more energy efficient:

The Urbana campus has joined other leading universities, including the 
University of Michigan, University of Colorado, and University of 
Minnesota, as a partner in the U.S Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) ""Energy Star"" program.  Energy Star provides information and 
experience-sharing resources for partner institutions, including 
guidelines for Energy Management, an Energy Program Assessment Matrix, and 
a Service & Product Provider Directory.
  
* We are in the process of replacement or repair of all deficient steam 
and electricity meters with the intention of more rigorous energy 
management. Concurrently, steam traps, a perennial source of wasted 
energy, are being repaired or replaced.  There are about 25,000 steam 
traps in campus buildings.   

*An energy-management Web site has been developed 
(http://www.energymanagement.uiuc.edu/) that provides helpful information 
for individuals, departments and colleges. 

*Also, a Web site specifically focused on computers, and other IT 
equipment is also available: www.cites.uiuc.edu/guidelines/energy.html.

*Students in engineering and environmental sciences classes are conducting 
energy audits of campus buildings and looking at ways the campus can be 
more efficient in its energy use. 

*The Business Instructional Facility under construction will comply with 
LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) gold requirements. 
LEED standards were created by the U.S. Green Buildings Council.  All new 
construction and renovation over $2 million dollars will be LEED 
compliant.  

*Recent lab suite remodeling projects in Roger Adams Lab, Burrill Hall, 
and the Materials Science and Engineering Building include heat-recovery 
systems. 

*Campus engineers, in cooperation with academic units, are including 
energy-reduction strategies whenever system upgrades or replacements 
occur. Campus remodeling projects include installation of higher 
efficiency lamps to replace the old lamps.

As you can see, a great deal is happening. We are making significant 
inroads and are laying the foundation for an energy-conscious, sustainable 
campus. 

I encourage all of us to think creatively about what we can do to conserve 
energy. The Provost and I are putting together the final touches on a 
Campus Energy Policy, which will be issued in the next 2 weeks.  This 
policy will provide energy guidelines for students, academic units and 
facilities staff.  Our next step will be to put into place an energy 
conservation plan. 
 
I know that it is difficult, if not impossible, to control energy use in 
many of our older buildings. However, as we look ahead, I hope we are all 
asking, ""What can I do to help?"" Here are some suggestions:

*Review the Web sites mentioned above.

*Assure that someone in your unit is assigned as the primary contact for 
energy-related matters, which could include collecting and passing on 
energy-saving suggestions.

*Review your daily routine. Assure that the electricity and heat you use 
are what's needed as opposed to what you have become accustomed to. If you 
have a thermostat in your office, set it seasonally to provide reasonable 
comfort, yet minimize energy use to the greatest extent possible.  Turn 
off lights and your computer when not in use.

I will provide periodic updates on our progress and look forward to 
reporting significant savings.

 Subject: Tragedy at Virginia Tech","To Members of the Campus Community:

The massacre of 32 students at Virginia Tech Monday has left us shocked and
saddened. As chancellor, I want to express the sympathy and concern I know
each of us feels for the families and friends of the victims. 

I also want to take a moment to remind you that while it is impossible to
prevent all incidents of violence, some of our best defenses are early
detection and reporting. 

Our police department has plans in place for a wide range of emergencies.
However, if you notice that someone is demonstrating or implying
threatening behaviors or actions, it is critical that you contact campus
police immediately at 911 or 9-911 from campus phones. Students can also
contact the Dean of Students office at 333-2121 and employees can report
concerns to their supervisors. In a world where random violence is all too
common, we must-as members of this campus community-watch out for each other. 

We are a family. You are an important member of it. 

For students who want to talk about the Virginia Tech incident, the
Counseling Center will be accepting walk-in clients, as well as individual
and group appointments. The number is 333-3704 and the address is 610 East
John Street, Champaign.  Faculty and staff can call the Faculty Staff
Assistance Program at 244-5312.  

As we grieve for the innocent victims of this shooting, please remember
that the best way to help protect our campus community is to treat others
with respect and civility and to report threatening behavior to the
appropriate authorities immediately.

 Subject: Current Safety Concerns","The Division of Public Safety at Urbana-Champaign works hard with our
community to provide a safe and secure campus for our students, faculty and
staff.  I write this morning to inform you of four armed robberies that
very recently happened in the campus district.

Between midnight and 2:40 a.m. today (March 31, 2007) four armed robberies
happened in the campus area.  These crimes took place in Illini Grove, the
natural area located at the northwest corner of Lincoln Avenue and
Pennsylvania Avenue; at Busey Avenue and Nevada Street in Urbana; at Wright
Street and White Street in Champaign;  and at Locust Street and Chalmers
Street in Champaign. In each case a man approached the victims and
displayed a handgun.  This suspect was described as a black male,
approximately 5' 08"" and heavyset. He was wearing black clothing including
a black knit cap. Another suspect was seen standing near where the crimes
happened.  This suspect is described as a black male, thin and
approximately 6'01"".  In each incidents, the suspect took personal items,
but no one was physically  injured.  Both suspects walked or ran from the
scene following the robberies.

University Police are working closely with city police departments to
apprehend the criminals.  If you have any information to assist with this
investigation please call Crimestoppers at 217-373-TIPS or the University
Police at 217-333-1216.  Most importantly, if you feel something is
suspicious, immediately call our local emergency number:
911 from your cell phone or 9-911 from campus phones.

These robberies are known as ""crimes of opportunity,"" because the criminals
look for people they consider easiest to victimize.  That means that we can
all take steps to reduce our chances of becoming a target.  First, pay
close attention to your surroundings; do not place yourself in a position
where you are unable to detect individuals who may be approaching you. Use
well lit and populated routes whenever possible.  Always walk with a friend
or join a group.  Better yet, use the services of either SafeRides
(217-265-7433) or SafeWalks (217-333-1216).

Your safety is very important to us.  In meeting our goal of keeping our

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Copyright Enforcement","As you may have read in the popular press, the Motion Picture Association 
of America (MPAA) and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) 
among others are increasing their copyright enforcement activities.  As 
part of this increased effort, the RIAA has begun to target college 
students specifically, which means that students who engage in unlawful 
peer-to-peer file sharing are more likely than ever to be identified and 
sued by the RIAA.  

We think that these increased enforcement activities warrant taking a 
moment to discuss the relevant policies and practices at the Urbana-
Champaign campus of the University of Illinois. 

The University does not condone the use of peer-to-peer software for 
illegal file sharing. Those who engage in it violate U.S. Copyright laws 
as well as the campus's own policies, including the Student Code and 
Policy on the Appropriate Use of the Computer Network. Additionally the 
University bears significant costs associated with responding to DMCA 
violation notices and the network capacity absorbed by file sharing 
reduces its availability for general research, teaching, and 
administrative purposes.   For additional information of University 
related copyright issues, see 
http://www.cio.uiuc.edu/policies/copyright/copyright.html. 

Often the software used for the purposes of illegal file sharing comes 
bundled with 'spyware' and other software that maliciously captures 
personal information that contributes to identity theft. You can learn 
more about protecting yourself from identity theft by reviewing the 
information at http://www.cites.uiuc.edu/security/index.html. Further, 
some file sharing programs, even when used for legitimate purposes, will 
use your computer to transfer illegally obtained material between other 
users. I strongly encourage you to remove software used for file sharing 
as well as to immediately remove any illegally obtained material such as 
music or movies. 

Students who are found to have illegally obtained copyrighted material 
through the campus network will have their computers immediately removed 
from the network and will not be allowed access to the network until they 
have undergone a disciplinary process with the Dean of Students Office. 
With the announcement by RIAA, MPAA, and others of the intent to target 
college students with law suits, it should be noted that many of the 
students sued have settled out of court for amounts on the order of $4-
5000. 

In addition to information on our own security website, both the 
University of Michigan and Chicago provide excellent information on 
disabling peer to peer programs, see 

http://www.cites.uiuc.edu/security/filesharing/index.html 
http://security.uchicago.edu/guidelines/peer-to-peer/ 
http://www.copyright.umich.edu 

We are both legally and ethically obligated to respond to every 
notification of copyright violation we receive.  I fully believe members 
of the UIUC campus community will recognize the seriousness of this 
situation and respond accordingly.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Research Board","March 27, 2007

Colleagues,

A number of you have contacted me regarding the article that appeared in 
Inside Higher Education Thursday, March 15 
(http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/03/15/uiuc), which focused on the 
impact that reductions in Research Board funding could have on the 
humanities. Below I share the background of that story with you. I would 
like to begin by summarizing several key points.

(1)  The Research Board is a valuable resource for scholarship.  A
     discussion has been launched as to how best to use funds dedicated to
     the Research Board in the future.
(2)  We are soliciting input on the issue from the Senate appointed 
     Research Policy Committee, Deans, and Department Heads.
(3)  Our common goal must be to build excellence.
(4)  We are a single university and in seeking comprehensive excellence we 
     recognize diverse modes of scholarship

The humanities are engaged in the study of the human condition and how we 
express our humanity and engage with society.  They support our mission as 
a public land grant university.  We, in turn, need to provide an 
environment in which all of our faculty can succeed at the highest level.

The Research Board plays a significant role in building our capacity to 
undertake research and scholarship programs that are institution and 
society changing.  In the deep past, the Research Board was focused on 
granting start-up funds for new faculty, providing them with the capacity 
to undertake projects of significance.  In the more recent past, faculty 
have come to depend on the Research Board for gap funding, for help in 
initiating  new projects and for support in sustaining ongoing projects.  
This long-standing and valued campus resource is feeling the financial 
impact of five years of campus budget reductions and rescissions.  In 
addition, the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research faces significant 
demands for resources allocated toward strategic campus priorities 
including faculty recruitment and retention.  These financial pressures 
cannot be reconciled without significant reallocations.  

The Research Board oversees three programs: a grant program, the 
Humanities Release Time and the Scholars Travel Fund. Total awards in FY06 
were $2.7M, while carry forward of those awards made in FY05 was an 
additional $700,000. This yielded total expenditures in FY06 of $3.4M. 
These funds are distributed ~52% to the Fine and Applied Arts and 
Humanities and ~48% to other disciplines across campus. 

Earlier this month, I met with the Research Policy Committee (RPC), 
chaired by Professor Lizanne DeStefano, to ask its advice regarding the 
best use of limited funds available to the Research Board.  The 15-member 
RPC is appointed by the VCR and includes eight faculty members nominated 
by the Senate, plus the Dean of the Graduate College, a representative 
from the Campus Research Board, one graduate student and one undergraduate 
student. 

The question before us is how to build and sustain excellence within the 
available budget. I have asked the RPC's advice regarding policies to 
ensure that available Research Board funds support strategic initiatives 
and build excellence by increasing our capacity to establish 
transformative scholarship and research programs.  In addition, I have 
asked the RPC to provide advice on the appropriate balance of the Research 
Board allocations relative to other strategic funding mechanisms such as 
Critical Initiatives in Research and Scholarship and funding for faculty 
recruitment and retention.  In conjunction with the RPC recommendations, 
as well as recommendations of the committee on scholarship in the arts and 
in the humanities, policies will be established for increasing support and 
expanding strength and excellence on the campus.  

In addition to this review of the policies of the Research Board, and as 
part of the campus desire to sustain comprehensive excellence, Provost 
Katehi and Chancellor Herman are working with the Senate to create an 
informal working group to develop a campus-level initiative in the area of 
arts and humanities.  A preliminary outline of this initiative was 
included in the February 2007 campus strategic plan.  The next step is to 
engage the campus community in a dialogue about how to work within this 
framework, and how to adapt it, to foster creative innovation and 
excellence in humanities and arts scholarship and inquiry across campus. 

As the RPC examines this issue, your views and ideas are very welcome.  If 
you would send them to researchboard@sab.uiuc.edu in my office we will 
make sure that they are considered by the RPC.

Best wishes,

Charles Zukoski
Vice Chancellor for Research

Re:         Strategic Planning Update


The story of Illinois is the story of remarkable people who dedicated 
their knowledge and creativity to building a place of excellence. Today, 
you are those remarkable people, and it is your turn to leave upon this 
great University your mark of excellence.
 
In January 2006, we published a strategic plan for the Urbana campus, 
outlining just how we intend to achieve our goal of preeminence among 
public research institutions. Over the past year, faculty and 
administrators have worked together to improve upon that plan, and today, 
I am excited to share with you the newest version of the strategic plan. 

http://www.strategicplan.uiuc.edu

Based on considerable input from deans, faculty, academic professionals 
and staff over the past year, we are moving forward with strategic 
research initiatives; focusing development activities around strategic 
goals; and embedding our planning principles into key processes, including 
the budget process, promotion and tenure and hiring practices. 
Working with the Council of Deans, we have developed values statements for 
the institution and aligned the key strategic initiatives around five 
broad goals.  The resources section now includes principles that will 
guide decisions about critical investments required to achieve our 
vision.  Finally, we have developed progress indicators for our campus to 
assess whether we are achieving the goals of our plan. Information about 
our progress will be added to the Website in the coming weeks and months, 
and I encourage you to use it as a resource for your unit.
 
I am grateful for the dedication of those who have worked many long hours 
to improve upon the strategic plan and to put our ambitious goals into 
action.  They know, as you and I do, that our moment to elevate Illinois 
to a new level of excellence is now.
 
Thank you for your help in making the next chapter in the story of 
Illinois the best ever.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Unofficial St. Patrick's Day - March 2","On Friday, March 2, 2007, many Campustown bars will participate in the 
annual business promotion known as Unofficial St. Patrick's Day (USPD). 
While the University does not support or condone this promotion, we are 
taking steps to ensure the safety of students who choose to participate, 
and to insulate academic instruction and campus operations from disruption.

In the interest of safety, Champaign Police will have a visible presence 
in Campustown on March 2. They will enforce all applicable ordinances in 
commercial areas, and have been given special authority to intervene if 
private parties threaten to disturb the peace. In addition, Champaign city 
officials have enacted special restrictions on liquor sales that are 
intended to curb overconsumption. Given the probable limitations of these 
efforts, emergency medical personnel will stand ready to provide care as 
required.

The profile of University Police will also be elevated during USPD. Their 
work will focus on protecting students, staff, faculty, and University 
property from harm caused by the disorderly conduct of event participants. 
Report emergencies to METCAD at 911 (or, from a campus phone, 9-911). For 
this event, requests for non-emergency response by University Police 
should be directed to 333-1216.

The Deans of colleges that enroll undergraduates recently sent out 
messages detailing resources  that college personnel can draw on to 
preserve the integrity of academic instruction and campus operations on 
March 2. Those resources include:

-- The Student Code (http://www.admin.uiuc.edu/policy/code/) addresses 
student responsibilities on campus. Sections 1-102(d) and 1-302(f), on 
classroom conduct expectations, and section on 1-307, on alcohol 
consumption, are particularly relevant. The Code empowers instructors to 
ask disruptive students to leave class; after class, names of dismissed 
students should be reported to the Office of Student Conflict Resolution 
at 333-3680.

-- If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into 
confrontation, it will be best to avoid confrontation and seek assistance. 
From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on March 2, teams of Student Affairs and Academic 
Affairs staff will walk through and around buildings with classrooms and 
lecture halls where disruptions were experienced last year. Roaming team 
members, wearing their University IDs as nametags and identified as 
university officials, may be summoned to assess problematic situations. 
Teams will be prepared to document any apparent Code violations and call 
University Police if necessary. However, instructors and students are 
encouraged to report emergencies directly to METCAD at 911 (or, from a 
campus phone, 9-911).

-- In the two largest lecture halls on the Quad (Foellinger Auditorium and 
Lincoln Hall Theater), both of which experienced significant vandalism 
during last year's event, students will be asked to surrender liquids 
prior to entry. This represents enforcement of standing policies that 
prohibit food and beverages in these venues.

Recent communications to students about USPD have stressed that those who 
choose to interfere with the academic mission of the University will face 
serious consequences. Instructional and support staff are thanked for 
joining the effort to reinforce this message before and on March 2.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Snow Days","To the campus community:

As we return to normal business operations on campus, I would like to 
thank each of you for your patience and understanding as we navigate the 
issues raised by this storm.

Thankfully, storms of this magnitude are a rare occurrence on our campus, 
so we have had to cancel classes only a handful of times in the past 30 
years. In each of those instances, the decision to cancel was based on our 
estimation that continuing with normal operations would have placed the 
lives of students, faculty and staff in danger. 

Despite the forecast for snow earlier this week, public works crews worked 
through the night attempting to keep streets and sidewalks clear enough to 
allow safe travel for pedestrians and motorists. However, when my staff 
and I arrived at work Tuesday morning, we were distressed to find that the 
storm had left many sidewalks completely impassable, crews were struggling 
to handle the 13+ inches of snow and driving winds, and pedestrians had to 
resort to walking down the middle of the street. We discussed the 
situation and quickly determined that classes should be cancelled and 
services reduced. That meant that all employees, except those providing 
emergency and direct student services, should be sent home.

That left the question of how to compensate those who were scheduled to 
and had already reported for duty before the announcement, as well as how 
to compensate those who already had chosen to stay home. Because the 
decision to reduce service was made after the start of the regular work 
day, we followed precedent in making our decisions.

* Employees who already reported for duty Tuesday and were told to go home 
would be paid for their entire regular shift.
* Employees who were scheduled to report for work Tuesday, but who called 
in before the announcement saying they were not coming to work, would be 
asked to use benefits or take approved leave without pay if they did not 
have sufficient leave to cover the missed shift.  
* Employees who were scheduled to report for work Tuesday before the 
announcement, but who called in and were told by their supervisor to stay 
home would be paid for their entire regular shift.  
* Employees who provide emergency and direct student services and who were 
told to report for duty despite the reduced service decision would be paid 
for the shifts they worked.

Tuesday evening, I made the decision that the campus still was not safe 
for pedestrians and motorists, so I announced that classes would again be 
cancelled and service would remain at reduced levels. 

Because I directed employees-except those providing emergency and direct 
student services-not to report for duty, they will be paid as if they had 
worked their normal schedule. These employees will not be asked to use 
their benefit time for Wednesday unless they were already scheduled to be 
off on an approved leave. 

Should further clarifications be necessary to address unique situations, 
the following individuals should be contacted:

To:	All Faculty & All Academic Professionals & All Civil Service Staff
From:	University Human Resources
Re:	Notice Regarding Graduate-Level Tuition Waivers

This notice is to remind employees of an important benefit to Faculty, 
Civil Service and Academic Professional employees who are taking graduate-
level courses and who are eligible to receive a tuition waiver at the 
University.  If you are not receiving a graduate level tuition waiver or 
do not plan on receiving one this calendar year this notice does not 
apply to you.

The university exempts the first $5,250 of the tuition waiver from 
taxable income in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 127.  
This exemption is based on tuition waivers received by an employee in a 
calendar year.  

University Payroll monitors waivers posted to employees' student 
accounts.  When the value exceeds the exempted amount of $5,250, the 
employee is notified of the taxability.  The notification will be in the 
form of an email and via the U.S. Postal Service to the mailing address 
in Banner.  Information regarding applying for an exception to the 
taxation, if applicable, will be sent at that time.

For additional information regarding employee eligibility and 
restrictions for graduate-level tuition waivers, please see 
https://nessie.uihr.uillinois.edu/cf/events/index.cfm?
Item_ID=1142&rlink=1121 and select your appropriate employee group.

TO:                 UIUC Faculty
FROM:               Michael Andrejasich, Chair, Honorary Degrees
RE:                 Request for Nominations for Honorary Degrees
 
The Senate Committee on Honorary Degrees is pleased to invite nominations 
for the May 2008 honorary degree awards.  Nomination procedures are 
detailed below.  You are urged to nominate, through your unit (department, 
school, college, etc.), outstanding candidates for Honorary Degree 
awards.  
 
The committee requests that nominations and supporting materials for the 
May 2008 commencement be submitted by February 16, 2007. Please note that 
in order to maintain absolute confidentiality, under no circumstances is 
any potential candidate to be contacted even to obtain lists of references 
and/or vitae.  Please use only non University of Illinois persons for 
references.  Only the President and/or Chancellor may contact candidates.
 
The Committee appreciates your help in identifying outstanding individuals 
whom the University can honor and, in so doing, honor itself.  If you have 
any questions or need additional information, please contact the Senate 
Office (333-6805).  For your convenience, a nomination form is at 
(http://www.senate.uiuc.edu/hd_form.pdf). 
 
REQUEST FOR NOMINATIONS FOR HONORARY DEGREES
 
The prime, controlling consideration should be distinction.  The person 
should have made a distinguished contribution to knowledge and creativity 
in the relevant field of endeavor, and have shown sustained activity of 
uncommon merit.  The contributions may be made in a wide range of 
activities; the following list is not exhaustive:
 
- Scholarship, in any discipline:  major breakthroughs in knowledge in 
fields of scholarly work.
- Creative Arts, in the broad sense of the term:  literature, music, 
architecture, engineering, et al; the development of new frontiers of 
creativity.
- Professions:  distinguished contributions, innovative work of 
distinction.
- Public Service:  outstanding achievement in statesmanship, 
administration, legislative activity, the judiciary, or in non-
governmental civic activities.
- Business, Industry and Labor:  outstanding, innovative activity in the 
business and/or labor community.
 
Following Senate guidelines (www.senate.uiuc.edu/criteria.asp), the 
Committee will consider, but not be bound by, the degree to which the 
candidate has had some association with Illinois - the University or the 
State.  While alumni of the University should not be excluded, honorary 
degrees are not a means of recognizing their contributions; other awards 
exist for this purpose.  Current administrators, faculty, or staff of the 
University ordinarily are not eligible; while emeriti are eligible even if 
engaged in teaching or research at the University.  Elected officials of 
the State of Illinois and its subordinate units and members of the 
Legislature, during their terms of office, ordinarily are not eligible.
 
Senate guidelines emphasize recommendations by departments and other 
academic units.  A nomination coming to the Committee from a member of the 
Board of Trustees, an alumnus/alumna or friend of the University, will be 
referred to the proper academic unit for support of the faculty.
 
For full consideration by the Committee, the nominator or nominating unit 
should supply the following information to the Committee by February 16, 
2007:
 
1.     A brief letter of nomination, summarizing the candidate's 
qualifications for this honor, and certifying the support of the 
appropriate academic unit.
 
2.     A brief curriculum vitae of the nominee, including addresses, 
telephone numbers, or other means by which the nominee can be reached.  If 
the nomination finds substantial initial support in the Honorary Degrees 
Committee, additional information may be requested from the department to 
develop the case and to provide the Senate with the materials it needs for 
the final decision.
 
3.     The names and addresses of at least four professionally-
distinguished individuals who could be contacted for letters of support or 
further information about the candidate.  It is hoped that oral 
communications among professional colleagues will help assure the 
confidentiality of the decision process.
 
Nominations and full dossiers should be marked confidential and sent to 
the Committee on Honorary Degrees, c/o Senate Office, 228 English 
Building, MC-461.

RE:        Faculty Nominations to the Athletic Board
 
The Athletic Board serves as an advisory committee to the Chancellor and 
the Athletic Director on the fiscal and operational aspects of the varsity 
sports program.  The Board is also responsible for that program as it 
relates to the academic and educational objectives defined by the Senate.
 
The Committee on Committees is seeking nominations of tenure system 
faculty members to fill two (2) vacancies on the Athletic Board, created 
by the expiration of the terms of Laurence Parker and Emily Watts.
 
Faculty members serve four-year terms.  The following faculty (with 
expiration of terms in parentheses) are continuing on the Board:
 
Lawrence DeBrock, BUS (2009)
John Erdman, ACES (2010)
Ann Nardulli, LAS (2009)
Christopher Span, EDUC (2010)
Tom Weissinger, LIBR (2008)
 
At the February 19, 2007, Senate meeting, the Committee on Committees will 
present a slate of four faculty nominees.  Upon Senate approval of the 
slate, the Chancellor will appoint two of these nominees.
 
We invite you to make nominations; faculty may also self-nominate.    
Nominations must include a brief (1-2 paragraph) description of the 
qualifications of the nominee, including reference to:
 
(1)  strengths in service and leadership,
(2)  major teaching and scholarly interests and accomplishments, and
(3)  experiences and interest in the policy and management issues that 
surround a Big Ten athletic program.
 
Thank you for your assistance; we look forward to receiving nominations.
 
Nominations must be sent on or before Friday, January 26, via email

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Violent Threats Unacceptable","To Members of the Campus Community:

It was brought to my attention earlier this week that threats of violence
against an American Indian student, and hate speech directed at all
American Indians, were posted on a pro-Chief Facebook website created by
students at the University of Illinois. The idea that the debate over this
issue could degenerate to personal attacks that threaten the physical
safety and well-being of members of the campus community is something that
all of us should find truly abhorrent. 

The men and women who built the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
over the past 140 years have worked hard to create a place where ideas
could be explored and discussed in a safe and welcoming environment.
Actions such as those that were recommended on this Facebook site really
are an attack on each member of our community, and that site has now been
removed.

I do not know the motives of the students who posted the threats, but I do
know that their words are dangerous and racist. The threats have been
forwarded to the Office of Student Conflict Resolution for investigation
and action. The Student Code guarantees that members of the campus
community should be able to discuss issues and express views, but it does
not allow speech that threatens to harm other members of the campus community.

As Chancellor, I can not and will not tolerate such violent threats.  The
University will take all legal and disciplinary actions available in
response to the threatening messages. 

But far less extreme actions and words can traumatize and frighten those
targeted, as well.  The right of free speech--no matter how thoughtless,
rude or dumb--is a hallmark of the American system. Yet as future leaders
and as citizens of our campus community and later as citizens of a nation
and world, we must engage in a far deeper dialogue about how we are to
agree to disagree. Vigorous debate is good and it is constitutionally
protected--but debate should be based on ideas, not empty-headed slurs or
vicious threats.

To all members of the campus community I ask that you think seriously about
what you can do to help build a campus climate with zero tolerance for
racism and hate. Everyone has a role. We should expect nothing less from
ourselves. I invite each of you to join us at 4:00 p.m. February 1, 2007 in

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Global Campus Partnership","A Statement from the University of Illinois  
on the Global Campus initiative  


A group of University of Illinois faculty leaders designated by Senates 
Conference along with student leaders and administrators met on Monday in 
Urbana to discuss the Global Campus strategic initiative.  

The meeting was convened by the President. The purpose was to ensure a 
shared governance approach to making the U. of I. a national leader in the 
rich mix of in-place and online education that all involved believe will 
be the future of higher education. 

The group expressed strong consensus and enthusiasm to pursue this mission 
with energy and commitment.  The group reviewed the May 2006 Global Campus 
plan, commentaries by the campus Faculty Senates, and an approach called 
the ""Three-Plus"" plan written by Professors Terry Bodenhorn, Nick 
Burbules, Vernon Burton, Faye Lesht and others.  

Based on candid, constructive debate and discussion, participants agreed 
to change the May 2006 plan in line with principles articulated in the 
Faculty Senates' commentaries and the Three-Plus plan. Among key changes 
to be recommended to the Board of Trustees and Faculty Senates include 
designation of the initiative as the Global Campus Partnership, reflecting 
that all Global Campus programs will have a partnering academic unit from 
the three U. of I. campuses. Agreement also was reached on an academic 
model with U. of I. faculty ensuring program quality. In addition, Global 
Campus will be created as an academic unit instead of a limited liability 
corporation.  

Next steps will be a Global Campus Partnership report to the January 18 
Board of Trustees meeting in Chicago by President White, Chet Gardner, 
Professor Bodenhorn as chair of Senates Conference and Student Trustee 
Sarah Doyle. Faculty Senate chairs will report to their senates on the 
meeting outcome and the President will work with the chancellors, provosts 
and deans on Global Campus Partnership matters.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - CFO and System Leadership Announcement","January 9, 2007


Dear Colleagues,

        I am pleased to inform you about the selection of a new Vice 
President and Chief Financial Officer for the University of Illinois and 
to update you on the status of other key University Administration 
positions.
        
        My recommendation to the Board of Trustees for the new 
position of VP/CFO is Walter K. Knorr, an experienced public finance 
expert currently serving as Comptroller of Cook County. Walter 
previously served as Comptroller and CFO of the City of Chicago, 
reporting to Mayor Richard M. Daley, and thus brings top line 
experience in managing complicated, multi-billion dollar public 
budgets. His private sector background includes senior positions at 
major financial firms. 
        
        Well-known and well-regarded in the public finance sector as an 
innovator and a straight shooter, Walter emerged from a national search 
that fielded 118 candidates and was assisted by the executive search 
firm Russell Reynolds Associates, Inc. A search consultative committee 
was chaired by Urbana business professor David Ikenberry and was 
comprised of senior faculty and administrators from the three campuses, 
including the chancellors.    
        
        The new VP/CFO recommendation will be considered by the 
Board of Trustees at its scheduled January 18 meeting in Chicago. 
Walter's start date will be February 1. Steve Rugg will then transition 
to his duties as Vice President for Planning and Administration.
        
        Also at the January meeting, the Board will consider my 
recommendation of Jim Weyhenmeyer as Interim Vice President for 
Technology and Economic Development. As associate vice president, 
Jim has spent the last six years of his 26-year U. of I. career intimately 
involved in all aspects of the University-wide technology and economic 
development operations.
        
        As part of the transition to new leadership in this area, I 
have initiated a review of the University's accomplishments and future 
challenges in technology and economic development. Leading the review 
will be Dean Prith Banerjee of the College of Engineering at the 
Chicago campus and Dean Avijit Ghosh of the College of Business at 
the Urbana campus. At the conclusion of their work, which should last 
about three months, the University will launch a search for a permanent 
vice president.
        
        Finally, I want to report that the internal search for a new Vice 
President for Academic Affairs is progressing well. Until the vacancy is 
filled, the academic affairs function will be carried out by me with help 
from Executive Assistant Vice President Larry Mann. A search advisory 
committee chaired by Urbana professor James Anderson is assisting me 
in this important task.
        
        Sincerely,
        
        
        Joe White

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Global Campus message from President White","Happy new year.

  I write to add my voice to the vibrant community discussion we have been 
having about the Global Campus initiative, one of the U. of I.'s five 
strategic priorities. Those priorities are:
--Make Urbana America's best public research university
--Make UIC one of America's best urban research universities
--Make UIS one of America's top five small, public, liberal arts 
universities
--Enable the U. of I. Medical Center and health science colleges to meet 
the education, research and clinical challenges of the next quarter century
--Make the U. of I. a national leader in online higher education through 
the Global Campus initiative
  Global Campus (GC) is a large-scale innovation and deserves special 
comment. GC emerged as a need and opportunity from our University-wide 
strategic planning process. A draft GC plan was completed in May 2006 and 
has been a focus since then of the University's shared governance process. 
Now we are approaching a time of decision. 
  On January 8, I am convening a meeting of faculty representatives 
identified by the Senates Conference, as well as several deans, Chet 
Gardner and members of the GC planning team. Our intention is to take as a 
starting point the draft plan and commentaries on the plan from the 
faculty Senates and challenge ourselves to reach as much consensus as 
possible about GC design. This will enable us to make a unified report to 
the Board of Trustees on January 18 and to the campus Senates in the weeks 
after.
  We have spent considerable time and nearly a million dollars doing 
extensive research and planning to enable our community to make a well-
informed decision on whether and how to make the U. of I. a national 
leader in online education. In this letter, I want to address the 
following matters: 
--Why Global Campus?
--What are the controversial elements of the plan?
--What are the risks in launching (and not launching) Global Campus?

Why Global Campus?
  The Global Campus initiative is driven by mission, mastery and money, in 
that order.
Mission: Today 85 percent of Americans graduate from high school but 
only about 30 percent from college. This massive education gap is 
thwarting achievement of individual dreams and impairing America's 
competitiveness in the global economy. The University of Illinois' mission 
as a land-grant institution is to bring quality education to large numbers 
of able and motivated Illinois citizens and others. We have a moral 
obligation to capitalize on information and communication technology, much 
of which was developed at the U. of I., to extend quality education to 
thousands of people who don't have the personal freedom or life 
circumstances to spend an extended period of time on one of our three 
campuses. Online education is especially important in enabling non-
traditional students, under-represented minorities, place-bound 
individuals and single parents to earn a college education. The typical 
student in online programs is employed and between the ages of 20 and 55
  Mastery: The future of higher education, including the residential form, 
will be a rich mix of in-person and online learning. Many high school 
students today take online courses. College students will expect and 
should have this option to enable them to complete their degrees in four 
years or less and to make education compatible with student mobility. (In 
my inaugural address, I showcased Jared Perry who continued his UIS 
education online while serving with his Illinois National Guard unit in 
Iraq. This is an option he would not have had as an Urbana or UIC student, 
and this must change.) We must rapidly grow the University of Illinois' 
mastery of quality online education and increase our capability to offer a 
large number of such courses at all three campuses. Global Campus is a 
means of achieving this goal. 
  Money: The University of Illinois is in serious need of a major new 
revenue source that can generate a substantial surplus to help us fund 
competitive faculty salaries and myriad other needs of which you are 
aware. We cannot count on increased state support for these purposes, and 
raising tuition much beyond the rate our Board has been approving could 
seriously threaten access and affordability. Success in research grants 
and contracts will help, as will success in our upcoming fund-raising 
campaign. But without a major new source of revenue and surplus, we are 
unlikely to be able to achieve our strategic priorities and have the 
brilliant future which we seek. Global Campus is by far our best new 
financial prospect. Pro forma financial statements show an annual GC 
revenue surplus in five years of more than $25 million. As a matter of 
proportion, bear in mind that for 2006-07, the increase in our direct 
appropriation from the state of Illinois (the first in five years) was 
$10.5 million. 

Controversial Elements of the Plan
  My reading of the commentary on Global Campus by the various Senates 
suggests that there is a high level of understanding of the vision and 
purposes of the GC. Concerns seem to center on three areas:
--The organizational form of GC, currently proposed to be a limited 
liability corporation
--The role of the faculty, both tenure system and supplemental, and the 
consequences for quality
--Future accreditation and degree-granting authority of GC
  These matters, and others, will be addressed at the consensus-building 
meeting on January 8. We should be flexible about organization as long as 
the form selected is fully compatible with success of the enterprise. With 
regard to faculty and quality, tenure system faculty will have course 
design, faculty selection and quality assurance responsibility in GC; 
supplemental faculty will do a substantial amount of the direct teaching. 
This is not a new or unfamiliar educational model at U. of I. With regard 
to accreditation, in the first several years of GC, all degree programs 
will be offered through Urbana, UIC and UIS. While we must position GC to 
have the option of seeking separate accreditation and degree-granting 
authority at some time in the future, that decision does not have to be 
made now. Campus Senates will have the opportunity to weigh in on the 
matter when it arises, and the Board of Trustees will exercise final 
authority on whether and when to seek separate accreditation of Global 
Campus. 

Risks
  In the thinking of the GC team and in discussion with the Board, faculty 
and students, three kinds of risk have been identified in the GC 
initiative:
--Reputation risk
--Value of degree risk
--Operational and financial risk
  If Global Campus does not achieve high quality in online higher 
education, the University of Illinois' reputation will be damaged. We 
cannot and will not allow this to happen. The tenure system faculty's 
central role in GC is our best means of ensuring quality. 	
  Some students have expressed a concern that an increase in the number of 
U. of I. degrees as a result of GC will reduce the value of their degrees. 
I have served at two universities (Illinois and Michigan), both of which 
have three campuses. The market-both applicants and employers-has a 
full understanding of these institutions and their various campuses. There 
is no evidence that multiple campuses serving various student 
constituencies have a negative effect on the value of degrees offered by 
these institutions. Indeed, the reputation of the University of Illinois 
and the value of all U. of I. degrees can be enhanced by the University 
demonstrating that it is the innovation leader in delivering high quality, 
affordable and accessible higher education. 
  There is significant operational and financial risk in launching Global 
Campus. We will need to invest approximately $20 million (an amount we can 
finance and partially recoup through foundation and donor contributions) 
before we begin to generate surpluses. Operational risks take the form of 
competition, enrollment and revenue shortfalls, cost overruns and other 
potential problems identified in a risk management analysis prepared by 
the GC team. 
  However, there is no risk-free path available to the University of 
Illinois. Not launching GC means that we will, to some degree, fail in our 
mission, in mastering online education and in securing the money we need 
to achieve our strategic priorities. We are, as I said in my inaugural 
address, at a tipping point. In one direction is a slow slide to 
mediocrity, which is unacceptable for the U. of I.; in the other is the 
opportunity (though not a guarantee) to create a brilliant future. 
  I thank all of you for your hard work on behalf of the University of 
Illinois. Thank you also for your serious engagement in the Global Campus 
matter. I am confident that working together, we will make the wisest 
possible decisions.

 Subject: Illinois Identity Standards","When the individual units that comprise the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign communicate a consistent, coordinated identity, 
collectively we amplify our reputation for excellence. 

We are stronger when we speak as one.

As you probably know, the campus has had graphic standards for several 
years, but they have been guidelines rather than actual standards. As 
competition among our peer institutions grows, it is increasingly 
important to build the Illinois name among key stakeholders. An important 
component of establishing a national name for our institution is to build 
a visual, textual and verbal identity. The new Illinois Identity Standards 
do that.

By implementing the standards, we will help key audiences recognize 
communications from our campus ""at first glance."" Using our identity 
consistently in print, electronic, and spoken communications at all levels 
of the campus will allow us to cut through the communication clutter and 
connect with constituents.

Today (Jan. 2, 2007), we will begin phase-in of the new identity 
standards. 

*Web pages and other electronic products developed after Jan. 2, 2007 need 
to comply with these standards. 
*Existing Web pages and electronic products need to comply by June 1, 
2007. 
*Print products developed after Jan. 2, 2007, need to comply with these 
standards. 
*Existing print communications need to comply by Jan. 2, 2009. 
*Print products currently in development, but scheduled to be printed by 
March 31, 2007, will have a grace period until that date. 
*Products currently in development that are printed after that date need 
to comply with these standards. 

A Chancellor's Review Committee with representatives from across campus 
will be appointed to monitor adherence to the new standards. The committee 
will gather feedback from units and will send official notice regarding 
non-compliant sites and materials. Units with materials and sites found to 
demonstrate proper adherence to the standards will receive campus-level 
recognition.

The full details of the identity standards can be found on the Public 
Affairs Web site: http://www.uiuc.edu/goto/idstandards.  A brief 
description of the standards is below. 

Beginning this week and running through early February, Public Affairs 
will offer workshops to provide more information and answer questions 
about the standards and how to use them. This week, workshops are 
scheduled for Wednesday, Jan. 3, and Thursday, Jan. 4, both from 2:00 p.m. 
to 3:00 p.m. in Room 514 Illini Union Bookstore. A full listing of 
workshops can be found on the Communicators Calendar: 
http://webtools.uiuc.edu/calendar/Calendar?calId=382. 

Thank you in advance for your adherence to the standards. This is one way 
we can ensure that our key stakeholders better understand the depth and

Dear Colleagues:

The administration is proposing a Global Campus (GC) now scheduled to be 
presented at the January 18 Board of Trustees meeting.  Faculty need 
either to endorse or to register their reservations about the proposed 
Global Campus.  This is very important for the future of the University. 
We must act now.  

This summer, when we received the proposal for the Global Campus, the 
Senate Executive Committee (SEC) established a Global Campus Task Force to 
help develop the campus response to the plan.  The Senate Executive 
Committee Task Force has made their recommendations in a very thoughtful 
report at www.senate.uiuc.edu/sc0704.asp.  (This link is to the cover 
letter; you will have to follow the link within the cover letter for the 
full GC Task Force report.)  The GC proposal, the Task Force response and 
recommendations, and a number of information items (including a video of 
the faculty campus meeting with President Joe White and special 
presidential assistant Chet Gardner) will all be available at the Senate 
Web site www.senate.uiuc.edu.  

The UIUC Senate will vote whether to endorse the recommendations of the 
Senate Executive Committee Task Force on the Global Campus at the Senate 
meeting next week, Monday, December 4, 3:10 p.m. at Levis Faculty Center

Before that vote, the Senate would like your input.  Please read the 
report and contact your senator with your viewpoint.  You are also welcome 
to email us (senate@uiuc.edu) about your response and suggestions to the 
Global Campus.  And, of course, all are welcome, indeed encouraged, to 
attend the meeting on December 4.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Reducing Energy Costs on the Urbana Campus","DATE:       November 8, 2006

TO:         Faculty, Staff and Students

FROM:       Chancellor Richard Herman

SUBJECT:    Reducing Energy Costs on the Urbana Campus

     I am writing to ask for your help in addressing an important issue 
our campus community faces.  Over the last five years the Urbana-Champaign 
campus has realized an unprecedented increase in utility costs.  This 
adverse financial impact in utilities was accompanied by new or deepening 
cost pressures in nearly every area of campus operations.  Today utility 
costs are now one of the largest components of the non-discretionary 
annual costs that negatively impact salary programs, tuition rates, and 
program expansion plans.  

     President White recently appointed an Energy Task Force of faculty 
and administrators from UIC, UIUC, UIS, and University Administration to:  
1) examine the factors impacting energy costs on all University of 
Illinois campuses; and 2) make recommendations to minimize energy costs in 
the future.  The Task Force is co-chaired by UIUC Provost Linda Katehi and 
UIC Provost Michael Tanner, and is expected to submit a preliminary report 
in March 2007 and a final report in May 2007.  

     While the Task Force findings and recommendations are critical to our 
longer-term energy picture, we need not wait for their final report to 
begin moving toward greater energy responsibility.  Regardless of our 
eventual energy procurement or management strategies, the campus will 
always benefit from reducing consumption.   Responsible conservation pays 
benefits both immediately and for the long term.  It is a universally 
prudent approach to diminish the spiraling costs of energy consumption 
that reduce funds available for our primary missions. 

     In light of these energy issues, I am forming a Campus Energy 
Conservation Committee to:  1) develop a clear campus policy for energy 
use and conservation; and 2) help identify areas of energy cost avoidance 
on the Urbana campus.  I have asked Terry Ruprecht to serve in a new role 
of Director of Energy Conservation for the Urbana campus.  He will work 
with colleges, departments, and Facilities and Services to structure 
conservation efforts and ensure that we begin to reduce campus energy 
use.   
  
     In addition to the above actions, I request that all faculty, 
students, and staff take personal responsibility in reducing energy use 
wherever possible.  Individual efforts may seem small at first glance, but 
they add up significantly across a campus the size of ours.  All members 
of our campus community can assist by:

     - Turning out lights in unoccupied spaces and during unoccupied       
periods
     - Lowering thermostat settings a few degrees in the winter
     - Raising thermostat settings a few degrees during the summer air-
conditioning season
     - Assuring that all lights, computers, monitors, copiers, and other 
equipment are shut off for weekends unless specifically needed
     - Helping achieve reduced operating hours of heating, ventilation, 
and air conditioning systems wherever practical 
     - Reporting wasteful practices or unnecessary use of energy to 
Facilities and Services  

     These kinds of voluntary efforts at other large universities have 
resulted in a measurable decrease in energy consumption.  Michigan State 
has seen initial drops in consumption of 4 to 8 percent on a similar 
request of their campus community.     

     Thank you for your cooperation in this important effort.  Not only 
will our entire campus community benefit from this increased 
attentiveness, but will help preserve the environment and precious natural 
resources.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Respect and Responsibility","Date:     October 31, 2006

To:       Faculty, Staff, and Students

From:     Chancellor Richard Herman

Re:       Respect and Responsibility

I was saddened and disappointed when I learned about the recent ZBT and 
Tri Delta party that ended up portraying Latino/as in stereotypical and 
denigrating ways. Students who took part in such behavior were being 
insensitive, thoughtless and, quite frankly, juvenile. Although I'm not in 
the business of telling students how to think, I expect more of our 
Illinois students. They are the best and the brightest of the next 
generation, and such callous behavior is beneath them. The challenges of 
our multi-cultural society demand that each of us constantly examine our 
biases and work hard to put ourselves in the shoes of people who come from 
widely varying backgrounds, cultures and experiences. We can have strong 
and differing opinions about culture, politics and policy, but we must 
never lose touch with granting everyone the kind of respect and dignity we 
would like others to grant to us. Everyone of every background is welcome 
at Illinois, and I want them to feel welcome. 

As is so often the case with these kinds of incidents, the ensuing debate 
is an education in itself. The controversy has spurred a great deal of 
conversation about treating one another with common decency, and that is 
good. The process of reviewing the incident is now underway, and I believe 
a deeper appreciation of our cultural diversity and individual 
responsibility will be the result. Vice Chancellor Renee Romano has been 
working with the various groups involved to turn what I believe to have 
been poor judgment on the part of students into a learning experience. 
Already, the controversy has added impetus to our plans to heighten 
diversity education on campus.

Yet, for the insensitivity that was shown, I apologize.

Young people are always works in progress, and I believe this event will 
help remind us all to be better and more thoughtful people.

SUBJECT: Speak Up Regarding University Pedestrian Safety

The University Multi-Modal Transportation Study (MTS) needs your ideas and 
opinions.   On November 1, 2006, an open house input session is being held 
from 1:00 - 6:00 p.m., in the Illini Union Pine Lounge, led by 
Martin/Alexiou/Bryson, PLLC consultants. MTS is focused on creating a 
pedestrian-friendly environment with a safe mix of transportation 
alternatives and is seeking input from the campus community. 

Faculty, staff and students are encouraged to drop-in at any time during 
the five-hour period to provide input on several main topics, including:

1.  Pedestrian safety - how can pedestrian safety be enhanced and what 
specific locations are particularly problematic?

2.  Bicycle safety - how can the existing campus bike path system be 
improved, and what kinds of other bicycle facilities are people willing to 
use on campus?

3.  Transit mobility - how can the MTD bus service be improved to get 
people to and around campus more efficiently while enhancing the 
pedestrian environment?

4.  Parking - how can the campus parking system be improved as the campus 
grows?

5.  Alternatives - what alternatives to driving are people willing to use 
to get to campus?

Thank you for your input on this issue that is so vital to our campus 
community.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Flu Season Preparedness","To All UIUC Students, Faculty, Staff, and Academic Professionals:  

	As Fall approaches, the campus is faced with the annual return of 
flu season.  You are aware that we have been preparing for a possible 
outbreak of avian flu, and the purpose of this email is to provide basic 
personal health and hygiene information intended to help persons reduce 
the risk of becoming ill.  

	The document, 'Avian Flu and You,' available at www.ocep.uiuc.edu
(click on avian flu), provides helpful hints for self-protection during 
the coming flu season.  We encourage you to share this information with 
family and friends.  These suggestions are relevant at all times of the 
year and especially as it relates to reducing your susceptibility to 
acquire colds, flu, and other diseases in the course of normal 
activity.    

	The following links provide information related to proper 
handwashing techniques: 
http://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/faq/hand.htm

http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/cruiselines/hand_hygiene_general.htm  

	Likewise, Dr. Ben Lounsbury, has created an excellent video with a 
humorous twist that addresses proper 'cough etiquette.'  His video 
provides information on how the spread of disease can be controlled simply 
by following common sense personal health techniques related to cough 
control.  The video can be viewed at http://www.coughsafe.com/index.html.
 
	Individuals may wish to store in their office personal hygiene 
supplies such as sanitizing hand gel and/or spray sanitizers for keyboards 
and telephone hand sets, and perhaps bottled water.  Bottled water reduces 
the reliance on the use of drinking fountains.  Individuals are encouraged 
to make sure they wash their hands before returning to work after using 
the restroom and/or when handling food.  When in public, be alert to 
potentially infected surfaces such as door handles, store counter tops, 
pay telephones, public restrooms, salad bar surfaces, etc. Reasonable 
restrictions on activities and the implementation of common sense personal 
hygiene habits have the potential to significantly reduce the probability 
of contracting a cold or the flu, especially if implemented prior to the 
start of the flu season.  

	Flu shots are an excellent way to reduce the risk of contracting 
the regular type of flu that we experience each winter.  Flu vaccine is 
available from many different sources in the community.  Please check with 
your provider about dates and places.  UIUC students should visit the 
McKinley website at http://www.mckinley.uiuc.edu. 
 
	There is an updated version of the Campus Incident Action Plan for 
infectious disease on the Office of Campus Emergency Planning Website:  
www.ocep.uiuc.edu .   Other recent and future 
postings will include information on personal hygiene, a 'self-
instruction' PowerPoint presentation explaining the issues around avian 
flu, and a list of FAQ's.
 
	Your continued assistance in preparing for the eventual arrival of 
the flu season and the possible arrival of a pandemic is greatly 
appreciated.  Additional information is available on the McKinley Health 
Center website: www.mckinley.uiuc.edu .  If 
you have questions, please direct them to Kip Mecum at the information 
shown below.

 Subject: Public Safety Bulletin","The Division of Public Safety at Urbana-Champaign works hard to provide a
safe and secure environment for our students, faculty and staff. 
Unfortunately, crime does occur, and I write today to keep you informed of
a number of incidents that have happened in the campus district since the
start of this academic year.  

Several people have been robbed, some at gunpoint, in the campus district,
which is bounded by University Avenue, Windsor Road, the railroad tracks
along Neil Street and Race Street.  These crimes of have taken place
between 8:00 p.m. -  4:00 a.m., and the suspects have used a number of
tactics to approach their victims.  These tactics have included catching
the victim by surprise and approaching individuals and asking for
cigarettes. University of Illinois Police are working closely with city
police departments to catch the criminals.

These robberies are known as ""crimes of opportunity,"" because the criminals
watch for people who they consider easier to victimize. That means you can
take steps to reduce your chances of becoming a target. First, pay close
attention to your surroundings; do not place yourself in a position where
you are unable to detect individuals who may be approaching you.  Always
walk with a friend or join a group. Better yet, use the services of either
SafeRides 265-7433 or SafeWalks, 333-1216.  If you feel something is
suspicious, call our local emergency number, 911 from your cell phone or
9-911 from campus phones. If you have information about the perpetrators,
call Crimestoppers at 373-TIPS or the University Police Department at
333-1216. We will post information on the recent robberies on our website
at www.dps.uiuc.edu. 

Our goal is for you to be safe, but we need you to always be aware of your
surroundings and to let us know if you see any suspicious activity. If you
would like to talk to an officer about additional safety tips, please call
us at 333-1216.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Fall 2006 Message on Research Integrity Policies","TO:  Faculty, staff, and students who conduct research
 
FROM:  Charles F. Zukoski, Vice Chancellor for Research
 
For compliance purposes, federal and state sponsors of research require 
that all faculty, staff, and students engaged in sponsored research be 
informed regularly about campus policies on research integrity.

The University-wide procedures for addressing particular instances of 
unethical conduct in research and publication are stated in the pamphlet 
Policy and Procedures on Academic Integrity in Research and Publication. 
This document is available on the Web at: 

         http://www.vpaa.uillinois.edu/policies/ai_toc.asp?bch=0
 
Under this policy, all members of the University community are expected to 
observe high standards of academic integrity and ethical behavior in 
research and publication.  Any practice or conduct by a member of the 
University community that seriously deviates from those ethical standards 
for proposing, conducting, and publishing research that are commonly 
accepted within the professional community constitutes academic misconduct 
in violation of University policy.
 
Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to:
 
   a. Fabrication or falsification of data, including intentionally 
misleading, selective, or deliberately false reporting of credentials or 
other academically related information;
   b. Unacknowledged appropriation of the work of others, including 
plagiarism, the abuse of confidentiality with respect to unpublished 
materials, or misappropriation of physical materials;
   c. Evasion of or intentional failure after notice by the University or 
federal, state, or another appropriate agency to comply with research 
regulations or requirements, including but not limited to those applying
to human subjects, laboratory animals, new drugs, radioactive materials, 
genetically altered organisms, and to safety; and
   d. Other conduct which seriously deviates from accepted ethical 
standards in scholarship.
 
Differences of interpretation or judgment or honest error do not 
constitute academic misconduct.
 
A student or faculty member who believes that academic misconduct has 
occurred has several options for pursuing the matter informally.  Most 
such problems can and should be resolved without resort to formal 
procedures, through consultation with an adviser, department or unit head, 
or the campus Research Standards Officer, Howard Guenther, Associate Vice 
Chancellor for Research.
 
The official campus statement on ""Responsible Professional Conduct:  
Guidelines for Teaching, Research, and Service"" is printed in the ACADEMIC 
STAFF HANDBOOK, available on the Web at:

         http://www.ahr.uiuc.edu/ahrhandbook/chap5/Default.htm
 
The guidelines are also printed in the HANDBOOK FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS AND
ADVISORS, available on the Web at:

         http://www.grad.uiuc.edu/gradhandbook/chapterXIII/section04.asp

 Subject: MASSMAIL - RFP-Faculty Fellows in Entrepreneurship","Entrepreneurship at Illinois
The Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership is the sponsor of a competitive 
Fellows program-The Faculty Fellows in Entrepreneurship.  The program is a 
key initiative in the Academys objective of broadening the understanding, 
appreciation, and inclusion of entrepreneurship in all disciplines.  In 
this context, it is based upon a comprehensive definition of 
entrepreneurship that embraces the social, intellectual, and economic 
value created through the application of entrepreneurial principles. We 
view entrepreneurship as a process of opportunity recognition and resource 
acquisition that leads to the creation of something new. This could be the 
creation of a new business, new approaches to social problems or 
development of career management strategies in the arts.

Purpose
The Faculty Fellows in Entrepreneurship Program is designed to stimulate 
and support the development and teaching of entrepreneurship courses in 
disciplines across the curriculum at the University of Illinois.  The 
purpose is to increase the number and scope of courses and experiences in 
entrepreneurship and to stimulate and nurture the entrepreneurial spirit 
in all students without regard to academic major.

Faculty candidates have the option to propose design of material 
emphasizing entrepreneurship to be integrated into a currently taught 
course, or to propose a new course that teaches entrepreneurial concepts.  
Candidates are also welcome to propose research components that will lead 
to curriculum enhancements.

Re:	Mid-semester Grade Reports for Freshman Students


Dear Colleagues,

Our campus has a long standing policy of sending mid-semester grade 
reports to freshman students.  However, the implementation of this policy 
was placed on hold for a couple of years to allow modification of the 
BANNER system to accommodate this need.  We have been informed that we 
can now proceed with implementation of this policy again.

Midterm grades are critical in helping freshman students gauge their 
transition to the rigors of college-level coursework and helping academic 
advisors identify struggling students in need of support.  

On behalf of the UIUC Senate Committee on Educational Policy I ask you to 
please comply with this requirement in a timely manner.  You will receive 
further details about the mechanics and timing of midterm grade reports 
from your College and the Office of Admissions and Records soon.

Please note that maintaining confidentiality of student records is 
mandated by federal law (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 
1974).  Please visit 
http://www.provost.uiuc.edu/resources/Faculty/FERPA_Faculty.pdf 
for more information on FERPA.

Thank you for your cooperation and have a wonderful day.

From:    Richard Herman, Chancellor

RE:      Request for Proposals from Civic Commitment Task Force


Early in 2006, I appointed the Chancellor's Task Force on Civic Commitment 
in the 21st Century to help create a sharpened and sustained campus 
emphasis on advancing the public good.  I asked the group to begin 
developing a campus-wide scholarly agenda that would explore how we as a 
university will help students and society meet the challenges of modern 
citizenship.  To share more about this evolving initiative, Professor Jim 
Wescoat, Task Force chair, will be the featured speaker at the Know Your 
University program presented by the University YMCA on October 3, 2006.

As part of its broader set of initiatives, the Task Force has established 
an opportunity for faculty and staff to participate in the strengthening 
of civic commitment on our campus.  I have committed the resources to fund 
a number of grants of up to $20,000 each to help the Task Force explore 
the many dimensions of civic engagement on our campus and to create new 
and meaningful educational opportunities for our students.

Details of the Request for Proposals can be found at the link below.  
Please consider submitting a proposal for new or restructured courses, 
programs or other civic-related intellectual exploration.  It is my 
expectation that the best of your ideas eventually will be woven into the 
fabric of the campus and become synonymous with the excellence of a 
University of Illinois education.

   As the new academic year begins, we remind you that it is each of our 
responsibility to treat others with civility.  The campus community is a 
remarkable array of ideas, cultures and experiences.  In your time at 
Illinois, you will learn from these ideas and experiences but in the 
process, may encounter people who have views that are different from 
yours.  The University values this diversity and works to create a 
welcoming atmosphere--where ideas are discussed and debated in respectful 
ways.  Unfortunately, some people choose to treat others with disrespect, 
intolerance and even hate.

   Speech and expression are our rights, and the Student Code guarantees 
that members of the campus community are able to discuss issues and 
express views, as long as they are not in violation of law and do not 
disrupt the operation of the University or interfere with the rights of 
others.  This is the foundation of a world class academic community such 
as ours.  When viewpoints are debated openly and civilly, truth will 
eventually emerge.  We are confident that we as individuals and as a 
university will always be made wiser and stronger by debate.

   Your educational experience at Illinois will be much richer, because of 
the many and varied viewpoints you will encounter in your time here.  We 
encourage you to reach out to classmates and others who might introduce 
you to new ideas and experiences and with whom you might share your own 
ideas.

This includes all the typical ""small items"" that are easily within 
everyone's control, such as turning off the lights whenever the room is 
unoccupied or when natural daylight is sufficient. If items such as 
printers, monitors, copiers, and office equipment can also be turned off

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Delay in Posting Transactions on July 14","Monthly paid employees who are enrolled in Direct Deposit may experience 
delays in the postings of payroll transactions to their bank accounts on 
Friday July 14.  The posting delays may occur due to a problem in the 
initial setup of services when the University changed payroll 
disbursement banks from JP Morgan to Mellon Bank on July 1. The bi-weekly 
payroll transactions on July 12 were also impacted.

Based on the bi-weekly posting delays on July 12, some employees 
experienced posting delays ranging from one to ten hours.  All monthly 
employees are expected to have their pay deposited to their accounts on 
July 14 as scheduled.  However, due to these posting delays, some 
employees may not be able to access their funds through ATM or Point of 
Sale early in the day.  The length of delay will be determined by the 
timing of the transaction delivery to the employee?s bank or credit union 
and by how quickly they post the transaction.

	LET`S ALL BE ACTIVE IN MAKING THE CAMPUS MORE SAFE

As we move into summer, we want to remind everyone of the importance of 
personal safety on campus.  Recently there have been three assaults on or 
near the campus area.  Persons have been arrested and charged with each of 
these crimes, but we all need to be vigilant and participate in helping to 
assure a safe environment for everyone.  Please review a few important 
safety tips to help us reach that goal:

- Use the MTD scheduled bus service.

- Walk in an alert and confident manner, actively pay attention to your 
surroundings; never walk alone after dark; use well-lighted paths.

- Advise the Division of Public Safety or Office of the Dean of Students 
of any areas of the campus where improved lighting is needed or lights are 
malfunctioning.

- If you observe any suspicious activity/people, call 9-911 from a campus 
phone or 911 from a residential or cell phone.

- University police provide walking, bike and mobile patrols of our campus 
community 24 hours a day.  They are well trained and prepared to assist 
you with any type of emergency that may arise.

- Make a note of the locations of the emergency phones around the campus, 
and use them to contact police if your safety is in jeopardy or you need 
emergency assistance.  If you ever become the victim of any crime, please 
contact the police immediately.

- You can check the Division or Public Safety website at 
http://www.dps.uiuc.edu to learn of any special security alerts or issues 
that may be of concern.

- Do not leave your room or apartment unlocked, even to go next door to 
visit a friend.

- Remember that the more alcohol you drink the easier target you may be 
for criminals.

- Share safety tips and contents of this alert with friends.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Amnesty Period for 60-Day Travel Policy ","The Office of Business and Financial Services announced a new policy in 
February 2005 regarding timely submission of requests for reimbursement 
of business travel and miscellaneous expenditures.  This policy was 
written to comply with Internal Revenue Service regulations regarding 
Accountable Plan rules.  In accordance with the policy, reimbursement 
vouchers submitted more than 60 days after the last date of travel or 
expenditure occurrence are to be reported as taxable income and 
appropriate taxes withheld from the employee's gross pay. 

The policy was implemented in January 2006; however, in an effort to 
provide departments with a final opportunity to process outstanding 
reimbursement vouchers, the Office of Business and Financial Services has 
established an amnesty period for the period January 1, 2006 through June 
30, 2006.  Reimbursement vouchers for business travel and/or 
miscellaneous expenditures that occurred prior to May 1, 2006 and 
received in University Payables before 4:00 p.m. on June 30, 2006 will be 
processed without being reported as taxable income. 

Effective July 1, 2006, reimbursement vouchers submitted more than 60 
days after the completion of travel or the expenditure occurrence will be 
reported as taxable income unless a Reasonable Justification form has 
been submitted and approved by University Payables.  The reimbursed 
amounts will be subject to federal withholding of 25%, state withholding 
of 3% and, if applicable, Medicare withholding of 1.45%.  This 
withholding will reduce the amount of the employee's net income in a 
subsequent pay period.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - A Message from President Joe White","Dear Colleagues,

This is a busy and exciting period for the University as the academic year 
winds down, commencements are held and we prepare for a productive summer. 
I write at this time to provide a brief update on the resource outlook for 
the University and, more important, what it means for academic quality and 
responsible stewardship of the University of Illinois.

I am pleased to report that, in a nutshell, the resource picture has 
brightened.

The state legislature just provided the University its first appropriation 
increase in five years; the Board of Trustees last month increased tuition 
and established a funding source to eliminate the academic facilities 
deferred maintenance backlog over the next decade; and, private giving is 
up this year.

I believe these are leading indicators of a trend toward a better future. 
They mean that we can maintain and strengthen academic quality, thus 
ensuring attraction, retention and development of an exceptional faculty 
and providing the courses, sections and classes our students need to 
receive a high-quality education and graduate on time. They also mean that 
we can make progress on fixing our physical infrastructure - repairing 
leaky roofs, crumbling concrete and the like. 

I have spoken many times about the need to forge a new Compact for 
financial support of the University of Illinois.  The Compact simply means 
that five parties must do their parts to ensure the University has the 
resources that are a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to create 
the brilliant future we all want for the University of Illinois.  

As we put together the University's budget for Fiscal Year 2007 (FY07), 
which begins on July 1, 2006, the Compact is taking shape very 
effectively. Here is a summary.

The first party in the Compact is the state of Illinois. The University of 
Illinois is the state's most valuable asset in creating a prosperous 
future for the people of Illinois.  We have asked the state to do what it 
can, when it can, to support the University.  After four years of cuts and 
no increases in operating support, I am pleased that the legislature has 
approved a 1.8% appropriation increase for fiscal 2007, which means an 
incremental $10.1 million in base operating funds for the University of 
Illinois. Unfortunately, a capital budget did not pass.

Tuition payers and their families are the second party in the Compact. 
University trustees last month adopted the administration's recommendation 
for new tuition levels to support its core teaching mission and a new 
Academic Facilities Maintenance Fund Assessment designed to help bring 
down our $800 million deferred maintenance problem to a proper level 
within a decade. These actions will provide $35 million in FY07.  
Financial aid from the University and the state has increased and will 
continue to help many students and their families pay for their U of I 
education.  Thanks to strong financial aid, only half of all U of I 
students pay full tuition and fees.

The third party in the Compact is our own faculty. Through your success in 
attracting research grants and contracts, faculty bring almost $700 
million a year into the University to support research and the operation 
of the University.  We are counting on continued success.  

The fourth party in the Compact is private donors.  Individuals, 
corporations and foundations play an important role in supporting the 
University of Illinois through annual and special gifts, both expendable 
and endowment.  This year, total giving is running considerably ahead of 
last year.  We believe that another increase in expendable gifts and 
endowment income from gifts is a reasonable assumption for FY07.  

The fifth party in the Compact is University leadership at every level.  
Reallocation of current spending from lower to higher priorities has 
become, and must remain, a way of life at the University of Illinois.  
This will come as no surprise to every budget manager.  We are counting on 
a 2.5% reallocation to free up resources across the University to 
strengthen academic quality and address other priority needs.  
Reallocation is hard but necessary to ensure that University leadership is 
doing its part to support the University of Illinois as we ask the state, 
our students and their families, the faculty and private donors to do 
their share.

As the Compact comes together, I believe that we can accomplish the 
following:

*Keep a high-quality U of I education accessible and affordable.

*Turn the corner in strengthening academic quality after four extremely 
tough budget years.  

*Serve as good stewards of state assets and fix a large deferred 
maintenance problem within a decade.

I said in my inaugural address that we must strive to create a brilliant 
future for the University of Illinois. Our strategic plans are intended to 
set that high aspiration level.  We must also have the resources required 
for excellence. I am pleased that we are making significant progress in 
this regard.  

I thank all of you for striving for excellence in your own work and for 
your efforts on behalf of the University of Illinois.  I look forward to 
working together in the months and years ahead.

Sincerely,


B. Joseph White

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Use of Animals in Research","Dear Colleagues:
 
Recent unapproved use of animals and deviations from animal care and 
use protocols have pointed to the need for a reminder to researchers 
of the responsibilities associated with the use of animals in 
research.   A basic training module for researchers using animals 
can be found at
 
http://www.dar.uiuc.edu/training/basic.htm 
 
Policies governing the use of animals on our campus are available at
 
http://www.iacuc.uiuc.edu/policies.html
 
All researchers intending to perform research involving animals are
responsible for the submission of an animal use protocol, which must be
approved by the IACUC prior to obtaining and using any animals in 
research.
 
This protocol must detail all activities that include animals in 
research and teaching.  It should be viewed as a legal contract into 
which the PI enters with the Institution.
 
Approval must be obtained prior to the acquisition of animals and their
arrival on campus.  Animals must be obtained from approved sources, and
appropriate quarantine measures must be taken.  Approval of the 
Biological Safety Committee is required prior to work with any 
transgenic animals, human or animal pathogens, nonhuman primate or wild 
mammal materials.  See http://www.ehs.uiuc.edu/bss/ibc.htm.
 
Similarly, approval by the Division of Research Safety (DRS) is 
required prior to the use of hazardous chemicals in animals. See 
http://www.iacuc.uiuc.edu/forms.html
 
Animals must be housed in approved animal facilities and provided proper 
care.
 
Research staff and students working in the laboratory must be educated
regarding the importance of compliance with federal laws and 
regulations regarding proper care, use and humane treatment of animals 
used in research and teaching, as well as the importance of following 
campus policies and federal regulations governing animal use.
 
All staff working with animals must complete and follow an Occupational
Health and Safety Program. See http://www.iacuc.uiuc.edu/forms.html
 
Failure to adhere to these regulatory requirements places the 
University in a position of heightened scrutiny by regulatory agencies 
and could result in fines, and restriction or elimination of our 
ability to use animals in research and teaching.  
 
If you have any questions about these responsibilities, or require
assistance in developing animal care and use protocols, please contact 
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) by phone to 
333-7789 or email to iacuc@iacuc.uiuc.edu.

St. Patrick's Day.  This event is not supported by the University in any 
way.  The Mayor of Champaign has issued an executive order that alcohol 
cannot be served in licensed premises before 11 a.m. on March 3.
 
It is possible that student behavior associated with this event may 
disrupt classes on Friday, March 3.  The University discourages 
instructors from cancelling classes.  It is suggested that both 
attendance and behavior expectations be addressed earlier in the week.  
Should behavior issues arise in your classroom, please keep the following 
in mind: 

1)    The Student Code addresses individual student responsibility in the 
classroom and the University will respond to student conduct concerns.  
Students can be asked to leave the classroom.  However, if circumstances 
suggest that a confrontation is best avoided, a complaint can filed with 
the Office of Student Conflict Resolution once class has been dismissed.  
Please contact: 333-3680.
 
 
For your information, the Student Code can be found at 
http://www.admin.uiuc.edu/policy/code/index.html.  Sections 1-102(d), 1-
302(f), and 1-307 are relevant to this situation.

TO:	UIUC Senators, Deans, Directors, Faculty

RE:	Nominations for Honorary Degrees for May 2007 Commencements

The Senate Committee on Honorary Degrees is pleased to invite nominations 
for the May 2007 honorary degree awards.  Nomination procedures are 
detailed below.  You are urged to nominate, through your unit (department, 
school, college, etc.)  outstanding candidates for Honorary Degree 
awards.  

The committee requests that nominations and supporting materials for the 
May 2007 commencements be submitted by April 1, 2006.  The Committee urges 
all units contemplating submitting a nomination to begin their preparation 
as soon as possible.  Please note that in order to maintain absolute 
confidentiality, under no circumstances is any potential candidate to be 
contacted even to obtain lists of references and/or vitae.  Please use 
only non-University of Illinois persons for references.  Only the 
President and/or Chancellor may contact candidates.

The Committee appreciates your help in identifying outstanding individuals 
whom the University can honor and, in so doing, honor itself.  If you have 
any questions or need additional information, please contact the Senate 
Office (333-6805) or Mary Mallory, the Committee Chair (244-4621).  For 
your convenience, a nomination form is at 
www.senate.uiuc.edu/hd_form.html. 


REQUEST FOR NOMINATIONS FOR HONORARY DEGREES

The prime, controlling consideration should be distinction.  The person 
should have made a distinguished contribution to knowledge and creativity 
in the relevant field of endeavor, and have shown sustained activity of 
uncommon merit.  The contributions may be made in a wide range of 
activities; the following list is not exhaustive:

- Scholarship, in any discipline:  major breakthroughs in knowledge in 
fields of scholarly work.
- Creative Arts, in the broad sense of the term:  literature, music, 
architecture, engineering, et al; the development of new frontiers of 
creativity.
- Professions:  distinguished contributions, innovative work of 
distinction.
- Public Service:  outstanding achievement in statesmanship, 
administration, legislative activity, the judiciary, or in non-govermental 
civic activities.
- Business, Industry and Labor:  outstanding, innovative activity in the 
business and/or labor community.

Following Senate guidelines (www.senate.uiuc.edu/criteria.html), the 
Committee will consider, but not be bound by, the degree to which the 
candidate has had some association with Illinois - the University or the 
State.  While alumni of the University should not be excluded, honorary 
degrees are not a means of recognizing their contributions; other awards 
exist for this purpose.  Current administrators, faculty, or staff of the 
University ordinarily are not eligible; while emeriti are eligible even if 
engaged in teaching or research at the University.  Elected officials of 
the State of Illinois and its subordinate units and members of the 
Legislature, during their terms of office, ordinarily are not eligible.

Senate guidelines emphasize recommendations by departments and other 
academic units.  A nomination coming to the Committee from a member of the 
Board of Trustees, an alumnus/alumna or friend of the University, will be 
referred to the proper academic unit for support of the faculty.

For full consideration by the Committee, the nominator or nominating unit 
should supply the following information to the Committee by April 1, 2006:

1.     A brief letter of nomination, summarizing the candidate's 
qualifications for this honor, and certifying the support of the 
appropriate academic unit.

2.     A brief curriculum vitae of the nominee, including addresses, 
telephone numbers, or other means by which the nominee can be reached.  If 
the nomination finds substantial initial support in the Honorary Degrees 
Committee, additional information may be requested from the department to 
develop the case and to provide the Senate with the materials it needs for 
the final decision.

3.     The names and addresses of at least four professionally-
distinguished individuals who could be contacted for letters of support or 
further information about the candidate.  It is hoped that oral 
communications among professional colleagues will help assure the 
confidentiality of the decision process.

The Senate Office will request letters of support directly from the 
references; please do not supply such letters with the initial 
nomination.  Nominations and full dossiers should be marked confidential 
and sent to the Committee on Hon-orary Degrees, c/o Senate Office, 228 
English Building, MC-461.

law about political activity. I encourage you to communicate the 
following to others in your department. The goal is to maintain freedom 
without overstepping the boundaries as laid out by the law.

University employees, as employees of the State of Illinois, may-of 
course-participate in political activities and events, but cannot do so 
on University time or using University resources.  Time spent at work or 
on official University business should be dedicated to fulfilling the 
responsibilities associated with the employee's appointment.  As defined 
in the law, political activity is any activity that is in support of or 
on behalf of any candidate, political organization or political office.  
If employees choose to participate in political activities, they must do 
so when they are not being compensated by the University, or they must 
use personal benefit time.  As many employees have non-standard workdays, 
the law should be considered at any time one is in class, holding office 
hours or working as a representative of the University.  It is important 
to remember that University resources (e.g., e-mail, computers, photocopy 
machines, fax machines, bulletin boards and University-issued cell 
phones) may not be used for political purposes at any time. 

The State Officials and Employees Act provides the following examples of 
prohibited political activity:
*	campaigning or working on a campaign
*	preparing or distributing campaign literature
*	making or soliciting contributions
*	attending or organizing political events
*	preparing or circulating petitions
*	assisting at the polls

Political contributions -- which include gifts, donations and loans of 
money or anything of value, in addition to fundraising tickets in 
connection with a campaign or the election -- may not be solicited on 
University property.  

The law does not intend to interfere in any way with the educational 
mission of the U. of I.  Political campaigning and the elections are 
often great tools for educating the student body and it is not expected 
that such content will be arbitrarily removed from teaching curriculum, 
but instead, the purpose of that content should be considered.  On the 
same note, political speakers who visit our campuses for education 
purposes are also welcomed within the limits of the law.  

For more information related to prohibited political activities, please 
reference the following:

campus in Spring 2005, the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student 
Affairs and the Office of the Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic 
Affairs invite you to participate in a survey regarding your wellness on

spiritual. 

The results of the survey will provide important information that will 
guide the Culture of Wellness committee in developing campus wide policy 
and practice that promotes health and wellness.  

The survey should take no longer than 5 to 6 minutes for you to complete. 
Your participation and responses are all confidential and anonymous.

To:     All Faculty
From:   Professor Vernon Burton, Chair, Senate Executive Committee
Date:   January 18, 2006
Re:     Seminar on Shared Governance: Pre-Registration

Senate Executive Committee (SEC) is pleased to announce that an inaugural 
Seminar on Shared Governance will be held on Monday, January 23, from 1:00 
to 4:00 p.m. on the 3rd floor of the Levis Faculty Center.  (Pre-
registration for the seminar, while not required, can be done at 
www.senate.uiuc.edu no later than 12:00 noon on Monday, January 23; onsite 
registration will also be available).  

Speakers well-versed in academic governance, including both the AAUP and 
UPE, will briefly address some key issues to stimulate discussion.  Shared 
governance includes basic faculty responsibilities: admissions and 
graduation requirements; courses and curricula; faculty hires, promotion 
and tenure decisions, organization of research agendas and engagement 
activities.

However, this meeting is not a general discussion of shared governance or 
a series of statements by the usual suspects.  Learn what authority 
faculty have and how shared governance works or does not work at UIUC.

This meeting is just a beginning; we cannot discuss all of the issues that 
we need to consider.  But we do hope to prioritize and get a sense of what 
is most important to you as UIUC faculty about shared governance and the 
Senate.  Some of the ideas that need your input include the following:

Is UIUC faculty governance broken, and possibly getting worse?  Should we 
strengthen the role of the Senate in faculty governance?  How can we 
involve more faculty and students in the work of shared governance?  Which 
Senate committees have real authority and responsibilities and how do 
faculty become involved?

What is the role of faculty input, the Senate, and shared governance when 
a strategic plan has to be implemented in three months?

Should the Senate sponsor programs at departmental and school/college 
levels to encourage faculty to participate actively in governance and to 
assist faculty in understanding the importance of a faculty voice in 
matters beyond the narrow interests of a particular unit?

How does the Senate review campus administrators and how can faculty have 
input into that review?

How is shared governance functioning on the level of faculty/dean 
relationships?  What is the recourse for faculty when a dean circumvents 
procedures?

How do faculty members start a new program, organize public engagement, 
establish a research center, teach courses in innovative ways to handle 
increased undergraduate student loads and involve graduate student 
specializations, or create cross disciplinary majors?

What is the shared governance role of the faculty in the issue of the 
chief?

Does the Senate need to change course?  If every faculty member can vote 
on issues online, do we even need a faculty representative body?

How does shared governance work at our peers?  What can we learn from 
their experiences, or they from ours?

This meeting is also an opportunity to introduce issues important to you 
as a UIUC faculty member.  Please keep January 23 from 1:00 to 4:00 p.m. 
open on your calendars.  Please visit www.senate.uiuc.edu where you might 
want to check out links to the Senate Constitution and Bylaws, University 
Statutes, and SEC Handbook.

website and will also be distributed at the event.  Thank you; we look 
forward to seeing you on January 23.

the experience.

Your complimentary tickets will be available for you to pick up any 
weekday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. between now and January 6 at the 
Athletic Ticket Box Office at the Assembly Hall.  Before you go to the

RE:             Pedestrian Safety-Motorist Survey


     For those of you who took the time to share your thoughts on 
pedestrian safety earlier this month by completing the pedestrian survey 
conducted as part of a comprehensive crosswalk safety study, I thank you.  
Your response was outstanding!  Well over 5000 surveys were completed.

     Today, I write to seek your input from a motorist perspective on 
issues related to pedestrian safety.  If you have driven on campus, please 
take a few moments to share your input by completing the survey located at 
https://webtools.uiuc.edu/survey/OrganizationSecure?id=3803641.

     As with the pedestrian survey, responses to the survey will remain 
anonymous and will be reviewed by faculty in the Department of Civil 
Engineering.  If you have questions regarding the survey, or would like to 
share additional information, please contact Professor Rahim F. Benekohal 
at rbenekoh@uiuc.edu.

     It is important that responses to the survey be completed by 
December 15, 2005.   Once again, with your help, I believe we can improve 
safety for all members of the campus community.

Thank you.

RE:	Faculty Nominations to the Athletic Board

The Athletic Board serves as an advisory committee to the Chancellor and 
the Athletic Director on the fiscal and operational aspects of the varsity 
sports program.  The Board is also responsible for that program as it 
relates to the academic and educational objectives defined by the Senate.

The Committee on Committees is seeking nominations from qualified faculty 
members to fill two (2) vacancies on the Athletic Board, created by the 
expiration of the terms of Kal Alston and Kathleen Conlin.

Faculty members serve four-year terms.  The following faculty (with 
expiration of terms in parentheses) are continuing on the Board:

Lawrence DeBrock, BUS (2009)
Ann Nardulli, LAS (2009)
Larry Parker, EDUC (2007)
Emily Watts, LAS (2007)
Tom Weissinger, LIBR (2008)

At the February 20, 2006, Senate meeting, the Committee on Committees will 
present a slate of four faculty nominees.  Upon Senate approval of the 
slate, the Chancellor will appoint two of these nominees.

We invite you to make nominations; faculty may also self-nominate.  
Nominations must include a brief (1-2 paragraph) description of the 
qualifications of the nominee, including reference to:

(1)  strengths in service and leadership,
(2)  major teaching and scholarly interests and accomplishments, and
(3)  experiences and interest in the policy and management issues that 
surround a Big Ten athletic program.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Campus Charitable Fund Drive","Dear Colleagues,

This year the Leading Together Campus Charitable Fund Drive (CCFD) 
campaign ends before Thanksgiving-on Friday, November 18, 2005. 

I share the happy news that the Urbana-Champaign campus has been 
extraordinarily generous in its support of the 11 worthy organizations 
participating in the campaign.  Each day of the fund drive we draw closer 
to our ambitious $1.1 million goal.  I am so proud to be part of a campus 
with such a large heart, and an even larger imagination.  Our faculty and 
staff are truly leaders in imagining and realizing the possibilities for 
our friends and neighbors around the state and around the world whose 
lives are touched by such generosity.

To those faculty and staff who have not yet joined the fund drive, I urge 
you to learn about the work of the participating agencies and consider 
participating in CCFD as a way to help demonstrate that our campus cares 
about the world outside our boundaries.  I know many of you support 
deserving nonprofits in other ways and I thank you most sincerely on their 
behalf.  But if you would like to consider joining CCFD, more information 
about the fund drive, the participating agencies, and an opportunity to 
pledge online are available at www.uiuc.ccfd.edu.  Or you can give through 
your department volunteer leader.  Their names are also available on this 
site.

With Thanksgiving nearly upon us, let me take this opportunity to wish you 
and your family a wonderful holiday.  Thank you for all you do to make 
this university a great one-and to again say ""Thanks for Giving"" to all 
our generous CCFD donors.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Reminder: 60-Day Policy for Reimbursements","This is a reminder that the requirement to submit employee reimbursements 
within a period of 60 days will take effect January 3, 2006. This means 
that if you need to submit a reimbursement request for expenses incurred, 
or travel that ended, ON OR BEFORE November 4, 2005 you must ensure the 
request is received by University Payables ON OR BEFORE January 3 or it 
will be considered taxable income to you. 

For example, employee J. Doe needs to claim a business travel 
reimbursement of $2,000 for a trip that ended on November 4, 2005, but 
waits until January 4, 2006 (61 calendar days) to submit the reimbursement 
request to University Payables. The reimbursement will be paid in full but 
reported to University Payroll as additional income to J. Doe. 
Consequently, tax withholding of approximately $600 (30% of $2,000) will 
be deducted from one of J. Doe's following payroll payments. If J. Doe's 
net earnings were typically $5,000, J. Doe would see a one-time reduction 
in his/her net pay to $4,400 ($5,000 minus $600).

The 60-day requirement is to comply with IRS regulations.  A business 
expense reimbursement to an employee may be considered taxable income to 
the employee if the request for the reimbursement is not received by 

University Payables within 60 calendar days of:
--the last date of travel (for travel reimbursements), or 
--the date the business expense was paid or incurred (for miscellaneous 
expense reimbursements) 

University Payables recognizes that there are special circumstances when 
it is impossible to submit a reimbursement request within the required 60 
days. In these cases, a justification for an exception must be approved by 
the unit head and submitted with the request to University Payables for 
final approval.

The Illinois Student Senate is providing a new service for all students
getting ready to register for classes.  Student evaluations of instructors
will be published online at http://www.iss.uiuc.edu/ices so you will have
the opportunity to learn what past students have said about their
instructors before choosing your classes.  The evaluations provide
information on the workload of the course, grading procedures, the overall
quality of the instructor, and much more. Make an more informed decision

process.
8.Follow the instructions at the bottom of the form to provide consent 
(identify your employer as University of Illinois and give your UIN as the 
Logon ID). 
9.Click the ""Consent"" button. 

After you submit this information, you will receive an e-mail from JAT 
Software indicating you have consented to receive your Form W-2 
electronically.  

If you have consented to receive your Form W-2 electronically, you will 
receive a notification from University Payroll on January 14, 2006, 
indicating that your Form W-2 is available online and giving you 
instructions on how to access it.   

If you DO NOT consent to receive your Form W-2 electronically by January 
20, 2006, you will receive a printed Form W-2 by regular mail.

*****************************************
3. NEW ADDRESS REQUIREMENT FOR MAILING OF FORMS

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Tuition Survey","Attention Students:
 
Voice your opinion on a tuition increase.  Vote on-line now at 
https://webtools.uiuc.edu/survey/OrganizationSecure?id=674272.
 
The survey takes less than 2 minutes to complete.  The quality of 
instruction will be determined by the amount of next year's tuition 
increase, so it is very important that you vote and that student opinion 
be heard on this issue.  Results of the survey will be presented to the 
University Administration and Board of Trustees.  This is your way to let 
them know how much you value the quality of your education at the U of I.  
Information on the website describes the possible levels of tuition 
increase and their impact on instructional services.
 
Current Freshman and Sophomores will not receive an increase in tuition 
due to the Truth in Tuition Act through the State of Illinois.  Please 
take this into account when completing the survey.  
 
We also want to take this opportunity to invite you to a Town Hall Meeting 
at noon on Thursday, October 27 in the Courtyard Cafe at the Illini 
Union.  This meeting will provide students with an opportunity to raise 
questions or concerns about tuition and fee recommendations with Provost

Re:          Earthquake Relief

An earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale rocked parts of Pakistan, 
India and Afghanistan on Saturday, October 8, 2005.  The number of deaths 
is over 30,000 with tens of thousands of injured survivors and over 
4 million people displaced and in dire need of relief services. The 
monumental effort required in order to handle such a disaster has been 
further hampered by torrential rains and mudslides across the highly 
remote mountainous terrain, and winter is approaching.  

The Pakistani Students Association (PSA) in collaboration with other 
Registered Student Organizations has arranged fund-raising events across 
campus in order to help the plight of the South Asian people affected by 
the earthquake. Donation boxes will be set up around campus over the next 
few days for those wishing to donate money to the cause. Additionally, the 
PSA and other RSO's are currently in the process of planning other fund-
raising events for the relief fund; information regarding them will be on 
the PSA website:  as well as on posters and 
flyers across campus.  The campus community is encouraged to support these 
and other efforts to help the victims of this disaster.

All donations collected by the PSA are being sent directly to the Edhi 
Foundation, which is the largest philanthropic organization in Pakistan.  
The PSA chose the Edhi Foundation in particular as the recipient for its 
donations due to the organization's unequalled relief network and 
resources within Pakistan.  Checks should be addressed to: Edhi Foundation

 Subject: MASSMAIL - ANNUAL MESSAGE ON RESEARCH INTEGRITY POLICIES - FA","TO:  Faculty, staff, and students who conduct research
 
FROM:  Charles F. Zukoski, Vice Chancellor for Research
 
For compliance purposes, federal and state sponsors of research require 
that all faculty, staff, and students engaged in sponsored research be 
informed regularly about campus policies on research integrity.
 
The University-wide procedures for addressing particular instances of 
unethical conduct in research and publication are stated in the POLICY AND 
PROCEDURES ON ACADEMIC INTEGRITY IN RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION.  This 
document is available on the Web at:
http://www.research.uiuc.edu/ai/index.asp
 
Under this policy, all members of the University community are expected to 
observe high standards of academic integrity and ethical behavior in 
research and publication.  Any practice or conduct by a member of the 
University community that seriously deviates from those ethical standards 
for proposing, conducting, and publishing research that are commonly 
accepted within the professional community constitutes academic misconduct 
in violation of University policy.
 
Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to:
 
   a. Fabrication or falsification of data, including intentionally 
misleading, selective, or deliberately false reporting of credentials or 
other academically related information;
   b. Unacknowledged appropriation of the work of others, including 
plagiarism, the abuse of confidentiality with respect to unpublished 
materials, or misappropriation of physical materials;
   c. Evasion of or intentional failure after notice by the University or 
federal, state, or another appropriate agency to comply with research 
regulations or requirements, including but not limited to those applying
to human subjects, laboratory animals, new drugs, radioactive materials, 
genetically altered organisms, and to safety; and
   d. Other conduct which seriously deviates from accepted ethical 
standards in scholarship.
 
Differences of interpretation or judgment or honest error do not 
constitute academic misconduct.
 
A student or faculty member who believes that academic misconduct has 
occurred has several options for pursuing the matter informally.  Most 
such problems can and should be resolved without resort to formal 
procedures, through consultation with an adviser, department or unit head, 
or the campus Research Standards Officer, Howard Guenther, Associate Vice 
Chancellor for Research.
 
The official campus statement on ""Responsible Professional Conduct:  
Guidelines for Teaching, Research, and Service"" is printed in the ACADEMIC 
STAFF HANDBOOK, available on the Web at:
http://www.ahr.uiuc.edu/ahrhandbook/chap5/Default.htm
 
The statement is also printed in the HANDBOOK FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS AND
ADVISORS, available on the Web at:

 Subject: MASSMAIL - 60-Day Policy for Reimbursements on Jan. 3, 2006","The 60-day requirement for submittal of employee reimbursement requests 
will take effect January 3, 2006. In compliance with IRS regulations, a 
business expense reimbursement to an employee may be considered taxable 
income to the employee if the request for the reimbursement is not 
received by University Payables within 60 calendar days of:

--the last date of travel (for travel reimbursements), or
--the date the business expense was paid or incurred (for miscellaneous 
expense reimbursements)

The 60-day requirement will apply to reimbursement requests received by 
University Payables on or after January 3, 2006.  This means that 
reimbursement requests received on January 3 for expenses incurred, or 
travel that ended, on or before November 4, 2005, will be considered 
taxable income to the employee.

If a reimbursement is considered taxable income to the employee, the 
reimbursement is paid in full but reported to University Payroll as 
additional income to the employee.  Consequently, tax withholding of 
approximately 30% will be applied to the amount of the reimbursement and 
deducted from one of the employee's following payroll payments.  For 
example, employee J. Doe needs to claim a business travel reimbursement of 
$2,000 for a trip that ended on October 31, 2005, but waits until January 
5, 2006 (66 calendar days) to submit the reimbursement request to 
University Payables.  The reimbursement will be paid in full but reported 
to University Payroll as additional income to J. Doe.  Consequently, tax 
withholding of approximately $600 (30% of $2,000) will be deducted from 
one of J. Doe's following payroll payments.  If J. Doe's net earnings were 
typically $5,000, J. Doe would see a one-time reduction in his/her net pay 
to $4,400 ($5,000 - $600). 

University Payables recognizes that there are special circumstances when 
it is impossible to submit a reimbursement request within the required 60 
days.  In these cases, a justification for an exception must be approved 
by the unit head and submitted with the request to University Payables for 
final approval.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - A Message to the Campus Community","To Members of the Campus Community:

Sarah Channick represented everything that is good about our student body; 
she was smart, energetic, involved, and filled with hope for a bright 
future.  Her tragic death last week left us shocked and sad and searching 
for answers.  How could this happen?  Who is responsible? What can we do 
to prevent this from happening again?

It is the sad truth that we live in an environment where each of us must 
rush from place to place--often while trying to do several things at once. 
That reality combined with the fact that vehicles and pedestrians must 
move side-by-side on the crowded and busy streets on campus creates an 
ever dangerous situation.  That means everyone--drivers and pedestrians--
must use constant care and caution.

Nothing is more important than the safety of our students. As we grieve 
for Sarah and her family and friends, we must also work together to do a 
better job of protecting everyone on campus. The university and the MTD 
already have launched an investigation into traffic and pedestrian safety 
that also will involve campus residents and workers.

I will do everything within my power to make the campus safer, but I will 
need your help to ensure that tragedy does not strike again.

payroll funds by direct deposit, or use a Paychek Plus!TM payroll debit 
card, will also receive their travel and miscellaneous expense 
reimbursements, and travel or program advances, by direct deposit. Checks 
will be issued only to employees who are not signed up for direct deposit 
through payroll or that do not have a Paychek Plus!TM card.
 
In addition, to comply with an audit requirement, the walk-through option 
for cash payment of employee reimbursements and advances will be 
discontinued effective November 1, 2005. You may submit your approved 
Travel/Employee Expense Reimbursement form or Invoice Voucher and 
Travel/Program Advance form in person or by campus mail to the office of 
University Payables at 506 S. Wright, MC-345 (may be dropped off in Room 
124).
 
If you already have payroll direct deposit, you will benefit from the 
convenience of having your reimbursements and advances deposited directly 
into your bank account instead of waiting for a check in the mail.  
Reimbursement funds will transfer within five (5) business days from the 
day the voucher is received and approved by University Payables.  You will 
be informed of the direct deposit of the reimbursement or advance via an e-
mail notification sent to your University e-mail account.

	Chancellor Richard Herman has asked the Office of Public Affairs 
and the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research to build a strategic 
communications plan for the campus, as well as to identify opportunities 
for building corporate support for faculty research.  In the coming weeks, 
the Survey Research Lab and the Hill and Knowlton firm will conduct 
interviews and distribute surveys among members of the campus to gather 
data that will help serve as the foundation for both of these projects.  
Additionally, the U of I Foundation and the University administration are 
working with the Lipman Hearne firm to create a communications strategy 
for an upcoming University capital campaign and a broader University 
marketing initiative.
	While these efforts are being coordinated and whenever possible 
resources are being shared, some amount of overlap and redundancy will be 
unavoidable.  In the coming weeks, you could be approached (more than 
once) for your input and ideas by one or more of the project

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Ethics Message from President White"," Dear Colleagues: 

The University of Illinois Ethics Office will administer the state's 
second annual online ethics training program shortly after the new school 
year begins. The training, which is required by state law, is done 
through the Illinois Executive Inspector General's Ethics Training and 
Compliance Center.  The training schedule is: 

*     UIUC, UIS, UA (excluding all graduate assistants): September 15, 
2005, to October 16, 2005
*     UIC and graduate assistants for all campuses: October 27, 2005, 
to November 29, 2005.

I expect all employees to complete their training as scheduled.  Our goal 
is that the University of Illinois will reach 100 percent compliance. Not 
only does the law require full compliance, but it's a good idea to renew, 
as individuals and as a community, our commitment to the highest ethical 
standards. The Illinois Inspector General sets the timelines for us and I 
have asked that our academic and service units work with employees to 
accommodate their training needs and reinforce the requirement 
internally. 

You will not have a month's grace period, as we did last year, so it is 
imperative that all do their training in their scheduled time block.  
This year, employee access to the online training will be removed by the 
Executive Inspector General promptly at the end of your appointed window 
of time.

Completing the training in the first two weeks of each block will reduce 
the need for reminders and individual follow up.  Ethics training is a 
serious matter. The law requires the University's own Ethics Office to 
report the names of employees who do not complete their training to the 
Inspector General, and ultimately to the Illinois Executive Ethics 
Commission. The commission may levy a fine of up to $5,000 against 
employees who disobey the law.  The Ethics Office also will report those 
who fail to do their training to the respective chancellors, provosts and 
vice presidents to take into account during annual evaluations and for 
consideration of University disciplinary action. 

The Ethics Office will reach you with additional details about the 
training program, including login instructions and passwords. This will 
be sent to you at your official campus e-mail address.  Watch your e-mail 
for login details closer to your training time. You may also visit the 
University Ethics Office website at: http://www.ethics.uillinois.edu for 
further information.

Thank you for your full cooperation in this important obligation.

TO:     UIUC Senators, Deans, Directors, Faculty
FROM:   Mary Mallory, Chair, Committee on Honorary Degrees
RE:     Nominations for Honorary Degrees for May 2006 and 2007
Commencements


The Senate Committee on Honorary Degrees is pleased to invite
nominations for the May 2006 and 2007 honorary degree awards.
Nomination procedures are detailed below.  You are urged to
nominate, through your unit (department, school, college,
etc.), outstanding candidates for Honorary Degree
awards.


The committee requests that nominations and supporting
materials for the May 2006/2007 commencements be submitted by
September 30, 2005.  The Committee urges all
units contemplating submitting a nomination to begin their
preparation as soon as possible.  Please note that in order
to maintain absolute confidentiality and avoid possible
embarrassment to the candidate and to the University in case
of lack of approval, under no circumstances is any
potential candidate to be contacted even to obtain lists of
references and/or vitae.  You may contact her/his secretary,
colleague, etc., swear the person to absolute secrecy and
obtain such a list. Please use only non University of
Illinois persons for references.  Only the President and/or
Chancellor may contact candidates.


The Committee appreciates your help in identifying
outstanding individuals whom the University can honor and, in
so doing, honor itself.  If you have any questions or need
additional information, please contact the Senate
Office (333-6805).  For your convenience, a nomination form
is at (http://www.senate.uiuc.edu/hd_form.html).


REQUEST FOR NOMINATIONS FOR HONORARY DEGREES


The prime, controlling consideration should be distinction.
The person should have made a distinguished contribution to
knowledge and creativity in the relevant field of endeavor,
and have shown sustained activity of uncommon merit.  The
contributions may be made in a wide range of
activities; the following list is not exhaustive:


- Scholarship, in any discipline:  major breakthroughs in
knowledge in fields of scholarly work.
- Creative Arts, in the broad sense of the term:  literature,
music,
architecture, engineering, et al; the development of new
frontiers of creativity.
- Professions:  distinguished contributions, innovative work
of distinction.
- Public Service:  outstanding achievement in statesmanship,
administration, legislative activity, the judiciary, or in
non-govermental civic activities.
- Business, Industry and Labor:  outstanding, innovative
activity in the business and/or labor community.


Following Senate guidelines
(http://www.senate.uiuc.edu/criteria.html),
the Committee will consider, but not be bound by, the degree
to which the candidate has had some association with
Illinois - the University or the State.  While alumni of the
University should not be excluded, honorary degrees are not a
means of recognizing their contributions; other awards
exist for this purpose.  Current administrators, faculty, or
staff of the University ordinarily are not eligible; while
emeriti are eligible even if engaged in teaching or research
at the University.  Elected officials of the State of
Illinois and its subordinate units and members of the
Legislature, during their terms of office, ordinarily are not
eligible.


Senate guidelines emphasize recommendations by departments
and other academic units.  A nomination coming to the
Committee from a member of the Board of Trustees, an
alumnus/alumna or friend of the University, will be
referred to the proper academic unit for support of the
faculty.


For full consideration by the Committee, the nominator or
nominating unit should supply the following information to
the Committee by September 30, 2005:


1.     A brief letter of nomination, summarizing the
candidate's qualifications for this honor, and certifying the
support of the appropriate academic unit.


2.     A brief curriculum vitae of the nominee, including
addresses, telephone numbers, or other means by which the
nominee can be reached.  If the nomination finds substantial
initial support in the Honorary Degrees Committee, additional
information may be requested from the department to develop
the case and to provide the Senate with the materials it
needs for the final decision.


3.     The names and addresses of at least four
professionally-distinguished individuals who could be
contacted for letters of support or further information about
the candidate.  It is hoped that oral communications among
professional colleagues will help assure the confidentiality
of the decision process.


Nominations and full dossiers should be marked confidential
and sent to the Committee on Honorary Degrees, c/o Senate
Office, 228 English Building, MC-461.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Hurricane Katrina","We all have seen the suffering and devastation caused by Hurricane 
Katrina, and our hearts go out to the victims and their families.  

The hurricane left thousands of college students without schools and 
homes.  The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is one of a large 
number of institutions across the nation working to assist these students. 
If you are contacted by a student or parent regarding the possibility of 
late admission because of the hurricane, please suggest that they contact 
the Office of Admissions and Records at 217/333-0302.  For financial aid 
assistance, please refer callers to 217/333-0100.  We are able to 
accommodate up to 40 students and have already received our first one, who 
will be on campus this weekend and will start classes next Tuesday.  For 
students who cannot come to Urbana, but want to continue their studies 
this fall, we are exploring ways to connect them to our Guided Individual 
Study courses.

Additionally, we are working with the Champaign County Red Cross to 
collect donations for all hurricane victims.  You can contribute Saturday, 
September 3rd and September 10th, at Memorial Stadium before the football 
games.  Volunteers also will be on campus Wednesday, September 7th, and 
Thursday, September 9th, at the entrances to the following locations: The 
Quad, the Physical Plant, Grainger Library, Wohler's Hall and the 
Veterinary Medicine Basic Sciences Building.

We also are exploring ways to accommodate displaced faculty and graduate 
students, and we are sharing our engineering and planning expertise 
through the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other response 
agencies.

There will be other steps we take as a campus to assist those who so 
desperately need our help, but these are things that we can do 
immediately.  Thank you for your generosity.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - University of Illinois Fall Billing Information","Welcome to the University of Illinois!  Whether you are a returning 
student or new to the University of Illinois, the Office of University 
Student Financial Services and Cashier Operations (USFSCO) would like to 
make your experience at the U of I a pleasant one.

During the past year USFSCO has implemented some important changes that 
add convenience to student account transactions.  The most exciting 
change is in student billing.  Bills are now available online.  Each 
month students receive notification in their official University e-mail 
account that an E-Bill is available. Using UI-Pay, the online billing and 
payment system, students can view and print their E-Bills, pay online 
with a credit card or electronic check (e-check), and enroll in direct 
deposit.  Fall E-Bills will be generated in early September with payment 
in full due on September 23, 2005.  

The University recognizes there are students and parents who need the 
flexibility to make payments throughout the semester.  In order to 
accommodate this need, the monthly late payment charge on past due 
balances will be reduced from 1.75% to 1.50%. A variety of payment 
methods are available at the University: payments may be made online 
using American Express or Discover credit cards or an electronic check.  
(Please note: there is a 2% convenience fee for credit card payments.)  
Payment may also be made by US mail or in person at our Cashier offices.  
For more information about E-Bills, and to learn how to grant a parent 
access to view E-Bills or make payments on behalf of a student, please 
visit https://epay.uillinois.edu/ebills.html. 

Mandatory direct deposit of student account refunds is another new 
initiative at the University. Students expecting a student account 
refund, whether from financial aid or from an overpayment of their 
student account, must enroll in the University?s direct deposit program. 
Student refunds are electronically deposited to any domestic checking or 
savings account, and funds are usually available 48 hours after a refund 
is processed. The student's bank account number and bank routing number 
are required to complete the online enrollment.  Students who have not 
enrolled in the direct deposit program by the time their refund is 
processed will be required to pick up a paper check at the USFSCO office 
on their campus.  We strongly encourage students to enroll early to avoid 
delays in getting any future refunds. Direct deposit enrollment can be 
completed at any time through the Self-Service web site located at: 
https://apps.uillinois.edu/selfservice/index.html (once logged on, 
click ""Account Billing Information,"" then ""UI-Pay."")

As another school year begins, University Student Financial Services and 
Cashier Operations looks forward to providing students with convenient 
online access to their E-Bills and promptly depositing their refunds into 
the bank account of their choice.  We wish you a successful fall semester.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - NCAA Policy Matter","Dear Members of the University Community,
 
The Presidents and Chancellors on the Executive Committee of the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association recently adopted a new policy to ""prohibit 
NCAA colleges and universities from displaying hostile and abusive 
racial/ethnic/national origin mascots, nicknames or imagery at any of the 
88 NCAA championships."" As those of you in the University of Illinois 
community know, we have been debating and discussing the Chief Illiniwek 
issue for many years now. The Board of Trustees has been actively engaged 
in addressing the matter and 18 months ago set about an effort to reach a 
consensus solution to the issue. The Board is now considering what 
response it will take to the University being included on the NCAA list of 
schools with imagery deemed ""hostile and abusive.""

To those who honor and revere the Chief, these harsh words will seem a 
terrible distortion. To some of those who oppose the Chief, these harsh 
words will ring true.  The NCAA recommendations also seem to argue that 
the very names ""Illini"" and ""Fighting Illini"" are themselves hostile and 
abusive references. I believe that this is an unwarranted extension of the 
debate.  We are evaluating the NCAA recommendations now and will seek all 
necessary clarification in what appear to be ambiguities in the decision. 
In the meantime, no change is being made in the use of the terms ""Illini"" 
or ""Fighting Illini"" or in the Chief Illiniwek tradition.

The University of Illinois is dedicated to an environment of respect and 
dignity for all individuals. Exactly what that means, of course, is the 
nub of our long debate. As a great university, we cannot shrink from 
freewheeling debate. That commitment is at the core of our mission, the 
core of our nation's value of free speech, and the core of our national 
character. Yet let us acknowledge that our varying beliefs about the Chief 
are sincere matters of the heart and the head, and let us resolve to 
continue to work respectfully across our differences to find common ground.
 
Very truly yours,

Richard Herman
Chancellor

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Legislative FY 06 Budget Update","June 7, 2005


Dear Colleagues:

	The Illinois General Assembly met its May 31 deadline to pass an 
appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006 (FY06), which starts on July 1. 
Here are the outcomes for the University of Illinois:

*	State universities were spared funding reductions experienced two 
and three years ago and appropriations from general revenue funds are 
about the same as in the current FY05;
*	The U. of I. will receive a total of about $700 million in state 
appropriations for FY06: $697.8 in general tax revenue, $2 million from 
the Fire Prevention Fund and $250,000 from the University License Plate 
Trust Fund;
*	Total state support for the University in FY06 will exceed $1 
billion, comprised of the amounts noted above plus $325 million in 
payments made on behalf of University employees' retirement and health 
care benefits;
*	No capital budget was approved for the second year in a row, 
increasing our unmet capital needs and adding to our deferred maintenance 
situation;
*	Funding was provided for important functions within two of our 
missions: $1 million for the educational retention CHANCE program at UIC 
and $750,000 for Illinois VENTURES as part of our economic development 
initiative.

In light of the state's serious budget situation, I appreciate the level 
appropriation for the University in FY06. I am, of course, disappointed 
that we did not receive the 1% ($7 million) increase in our budget 
recommended by the Illinois Board of Higher Education.

In appropriations hearings and personal meetings with legislators, I 
found that most lawmakers recognize the tremendous value of public higher 
education. But legislators and the Governor faced a very difficult task 
in producing a balanced budget due to a structural imbalance between 
necessary expenditures and available revenue.

While the revenue outlook has improved moderately for FY06, the growth 
rates of program expenditures--particularly those associated with health 
care and retirement systems--continue to far outpace projected revenues. 
With no widespread support for tax increases, large spending cuts loomed 
in the budget process. 

Instead, the General Assembly ultimately decided to modify pension 
benefits for public employees and to reduce pension system contributions 
for the next two years. (Additional details on this matter can be found 
on the State Universities Retirement System--SURS--website:www.surs.com/) 
All indications are that the Governor will sign the budget legislation 
without making significant changes.

I am committed to maintaining the excellence of the University of 
Illinois and will work with the Board of Trustees to ensure we have the 
resources we need in the years ahead.

I deeply appreciate your hard work and dedication to the University of 
Illinois. I wish you a pleasant and productive summer.  


Best regards,

Joe 

B. Joseph White

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Your Monthly Payment on May 16","In March you received an e-mail explaining that your monthly payment on 
March 16, 2005, may have shown a slightly larger amount of net pay, due to 
a processing data entry error.  This error caused the excess life 
calculation to be missed in the payroll processing, and the monthly tax 
and SURS deductions related to your life insurance coverage not to be 
withheld, thus resulting in a slightly larger amount of net pay. 

If you were one of the employees impacted by this situation, this is a 
reminder that your May payment may show a slightly lower amount of net 
pay. To correct the under withholding on March 16, we have adjusted your 
May excess life amount, causing an increase in the deductions on your May 
16 pay, thus resulting in a slightly lower amount in your May payment.

We again apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused you. If you 
have specific questions about this situation, please contact the Payroll 
Service Center at (payinq@uillinois.edu), 866-476-3586, or 217-265-6363.

Re: Faculty Suggestions for Provost Search Committee

Richard Herman, former Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, 
will be appointed Chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign, pending approval of the University Board of Trustees on May 19, 
2005.  As a result, the Senate Committee on Committees has been asked to 
develop a slate of nominees for the selection of a new provost and vice 
chancellor for academic affairs.

According to procedures approved by the Senate on April 25, 2005, a 
Provost Search Committee will consist of 11 members: eight faculty (five 
elected by the Senate; three appointed by the Chancellor), two students 
(one elected by the Senate; one appointed by the Chancellor), and one 
academic professional appointed by the Chancellor. One or more of the 
faculty appointees may have administrative appointments. The Chancellor 
will appoint a chair from among the eight faculty members.  The 
composition of the committee is identical to recent provost searches.

The Committee on Committees will present 10 to 12 names for the five 
faculty positions.  Therefore, we ask that faculty suggest names for 
membership on the Search Committee.  Suggestions that represent the 
diverse perspectives of the University are welcomed. 

Please send names via campus mail, email, or hand-delivery, by noon on 
Tuesday, May 10, 2005 to:

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Standard resolution for ITS classroom computers","UIUC faculty and staff,

This message is for those of you who use the audiovisual equipment in the 
Integrated Teaching Systems (ITS) classrooms on campus.  Our office will 
be making a change starting with the Fall 2005 semester.  At that time, 
all the ITS resident computers will be set to a standard screen 
resolution of 1024 by 768.  We hope that by making this announcement well 
in advance of the change we will give instructors plenty of time to make 
any necessary changes.  Staying consistent across classrooms means that 
instructors will not have to change their content when they teach in 
different classrooms.

Currently, most of the resident computers are at 800 by 600, but many 
applications are requiring a higher resolution and 1024 by 768 has become 
the resolution of choice for the majority of campus computer users.  
Also, the native resolution of the LCD projectors currently installed in 
all the ITS classrooms is 1024 by 768.

including handling resolutions, go to our website at:

Dear faculty, staff and students: 

	It is with great pleasure that I inform you that Richard Herman 
will be the permanent chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana.

	Richard has done a stellar job as interim chancellor since last 
summer and he emerged as the clear choice to hold the post on a permanent 
basis after a national search that lasted nine months and attracted a 
superb field of experienced leaders in higher education.

	Since I joined the University of Illinois in January, I have 
found Richard to be a talented leader who brings to the job a combination 
of integrity, intellect and passion. I have the utmost confidence he is 
the person best suited at this moment in our 138-year history to lead the 
university to continued greatness.

	The Board of Trustees is unanimous in sharing my confidence in 
Richard's leadership capabilities. The Board will act on Richard's 
appointment at its next scheduled meeting May 19 in Chicago.

	Richard prevailed in an exceptionally qualified field of 
candidates brought forth by the Search Committee to Assist in the 
Selection of a Chancellor. I extend our collective thanks to the 
committee for its dedication to an assignment of such importance. I 
especially commend the committee chair, Professor James D. Anderson, and 
Mr. Bill Funk of Korn/Ferry International.

	News of Richard Herman's selection and his background can be 
found at: www.uiuc.edu/newchancellor
	 
	Please join me in congratulating Dr. Richard Herman as the next 
chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Reaching out to distressed students","TO:	Faculty

FROM:	Jesse Delia,Acting Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs
	Patricia Askew,Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs


We are writing to enlist your help in dealing with students who may be 
struggling emotionally, psychologically, or academically. Because you are 
the ""front line"" personnel of the University, your connections to the 
students you teach and mentor are critical components of the support the 
University works hard to provide students. 

Across the nation, in the past few years, there has been a noticeable 
increase in the number of students coming to campus already diagnosed with 
mental illnesses, on psychotropic medication, or with a substance abuse 
problem. Additionally, campus administrators nationwide have remarked that 
students, overall, seem to struggle with higher levels of anxiety, 
depression, and emotional distress than in previous years.  In general, 
today?s students seem less resilient and more prone to psychological 
distress than students of previous decades. This changing psychological 
profile among college students may account for the upsurge in demand for 
counseling services that we are seeing here on our campus, as well as the 
increase in suicide attempts over the past two or three years. 

Some of the behavioral signs of psychological crisis or acute distress are 
as follows:

Sad, anxious, or empty mood.
Expressions of hopelessness or extreme pessimism.
Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, helplessness.
Lost interest or pleasure in hobbies and social activities.
Fatigued or slowed down behavior.
Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions.
Problems sleeping, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping.
Appetite or weight changes.
Agitation or irritability.
Social withdrawal.
Diminished hygiene (stops washing hair, bathing, changing clothes).

Other signs that instructors might be especially cognizant of include:

Diminished class attendance.
Significant decline in academic performance.
Failure to keep appointments with faculty or teaching assistants.
Failure (especially among graduate students) to make satisfactory progress 
in their program of study or to be in contact with their graduate advisor.
Difficulty completing or submitting assignments in a timely manner.
Speech that seems disorganized or confusing.

While these behavioral markers do not always parallel a psychological 
problem, they may be indicative of someone who is not managing his or her 
life very effectively. So these types of behaviors merit ""checking out"" 
with the student. This inquiry might be accomplished by having a 
conversation with the student to see if he or she is feeling in crisis or 
overwhelmed by life demands.

Therefore, we are asking for your help. We know from national statistics 
that early referral to counseling services for students who are struggling 
psychologically is the best way to treat their problems effectively, and 
we know from studies that effective treatment positively correlates to 
academic persistence and retention. Our counseling services include a 
suicide prevention program that is nationally recognized. If you observe 
or believe that one of your students is struggling with psychological 
problems, is in crisis, or is floundering academically, please refer them 
to one of the following resources for help:

 Subject: MASSMAIL - CITES unveils e-mail antivirus controls","On Wednesday, March 2nd, CITES will provide a new tool to help UIUC e-mail
users combat computer viruses. Incoming campus e-mail will be scanned for
viruses. Whenever the new antivirus control detects a virus in an e-mail,
the e-mail will be automatically deleted before it reaches the user's mailbox.

This service will be automatically provided to anyone using
'netid@uiuc.edu' as his or her e-mail address. The antivirus software works
transparently and requires no action to be taken by the user.

Viruses are a problem for any network and the network at UIUC is no
exception. Over a one week testing period in February the new antivirus
controls identified 121,052 e-mails as e-mails that contained a virus.

While the antivirus controls will help stem the spread of viruses by
e-mail, it is important for users to not rely solely on this service. 
Viruses can still be spread by other means over a network. It is therefore
important for users to retain and continually update the antivirus software
on their own computers. Antivirus software for personal computers is
provided at no cost to members of the UIUC community on the campus webstore
at http://webstore.cites.uiuc.edu.

The e-mail antivirus control is a component of CITES Spam Control service.
Beginning in April, the UIUC community will be invited to activate the
anti-spam controls for their campus e-mail. This activation will take place
in several stages and will help reduce the amount of spam entering campus
e-mail accounts. CITES will provide more information on the anti-spam
activation as it becomes available.

For further information on CITES Spam Control, see the project status web

 Subject: MASSMAIL - A note from President Joe White:","


Monday, January 31, 2005

To the University of Illinois Community:

The first day on a new job always gets the adrenalin going. That is 
certainly the case with me on this day, my first as 16th president of the 
University of Illinois. 

My wife, Mary, and I moved into the President's House ten days ago, with 
our dog, Webster - small in stature, big in personality. The house has 
served U of I presidents since the 1930s and it is a privilege to make it 
our home. We look forward to welcoming many of you there, from our three 
campuses, in the years ahead. 

I want you to know how honored I am to serve you and this great 
University as president.  I believe deeply in the transforming power of 
education and research and in the value of a great public university with 
its mission of service. The University of Illinois is one of the world's 
great universities; it has a rich history and an exciting future.  I look 
forward to continuing the University's tradition of longevity in 
presidential leadership.  

In this regard, I want to thank former President Jim Stukel for his deep 
commitment and distinguished contributions to the University of Illinois 
for more than forty years.  Mary and I are grateful to Jim and Joan for 
welcoming us so warmly. And we join the University community in wishing 
them the very best in the years ahead.   

To faculty and staff: thank you for the part you play in the life of the 
University. I know that you have weathered difficult times in recent 
years. I cannot promise they are over but I will do my best to bring in 
the resources we need.

To students: At the top of my agenda is enhancing the quality of your 
education and maximizing the value of your degrees. 

Since my appointment was announced November 2, I have visited our three 
campuses several times, and met students, faculty and staff in Chicago, 
Springfield and Urbana as well as trustees, mayors, legislators, media 
and alumni. This has been a great experience!  Clearly, there is no 
shortage of human energy and interest to tap as we chart the course and 
secure the future of our great University. In my first week I will be 
back to all three campuses, building on and expanding the contacts made 
in the last three months. 

Like you, I hate long e-mail messages, so let me conclude by telling you 
what I hope to accomplish on your behalf as president. I would like to 
look back years from now and say that while I served:
      -	Members of our community thrived professionally and personally.
      -	The world's esteem for and our own pride in the University of 
        Illinois soared.
      -	We helped create a positive future for the people of Illinois 
        through U of I contributions in such vital areas as education
        health care and economic development.
      -	We created a new compact among key stakeholders to ensure proper 
        funding of the University.
      -	We worked with each other every day with integrity, honesty and a 
        sense of humor and perspective and we always treated each other
        with dignity and respect.

I hope these aspirations square with your own.  I welcome your thoughts 
and ideas and look forward to a great future together.  

Yours for Illinois, 
Joe White

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Process to Determine Translational Research Needs","As a follow-up to my memo of a December 2, 2004, I am writing to thank you 
for your comments and guidance to the Campus Translational Research 
Advisory Committee (CTRAC).  As you may know, the committee has been asked 
to develop a process for leading the campus toward a strategic plan for 
present and future investment in translational research that will impact 
human health and society.  The committee defines translational research as 
those activities or resources that facilitate the ability of fundamental 
research to impact biomedical science and human health. Your replies have 
helped us identify a few areas on which to focus further discussion.  

The next phase of information gathering will lead us to understand 
overlapping needs and specific opportunities within each focus group.  We 
will hold a series of open discussions February 7-11, 2005 to promote 
dialogue among interested faculty members.  These initial discussions will 
focus on biological research areas that lack a readily identifiable path 
toward application to human health.  Faculty members and administrators 
are welcome to attend any or all of the discussions, which will be led by 
members of the committee.  A series of questions, which accompanies this 
memo, will guide the discussion.  Please take a look at the attached focus 
groups.  To register for those discussions you plan to attend, please 
visit the Translational Research website at 
http://www.research.uiuc.edu/translational/.  Schedules and location are 
available on the website.

Questions for assessing Translational Research needs and opportunities:

What do you need in your area that would move your ideas toward 
application to the human condition? For example what facilities, resources 
or expertise are missing?

Do you need a mechanism to identify areas of clinical relevance that could 
be applied to your area of interest? 

To move forward should we build on existing strengths or invest in new 
areas?  What are our existing strengths? If we pursue new areas, what are 
the opportunities? Is it feasible to pursue these opportunities?

Re: December 29 is No Voluntary Deduction Payroll   

The December 29 bi-weekly payroll is a ""no voluntary deduction payroll."" 
This means that voluntary deductions (health insurance, life insurance, 
etc.) will not be deducted from employees' payments.  However, Credit 
Union direct deposits will still go to designated accounts since they are 
no longer considered payroll deductions.

If you have questions please contact the University Payroll Service Center

For those of you interested in using the Integrated Teaching Systems 
(ITS) for your class instruction, we will soon be making a change in how 
our office handles training and the distribution of access codes.  
Starting with those instructors who request codes for the upcoming spring 
semester, training by our office staff will no longer be required.  We 
believe that this policy change will give instructors more timely access 
to the classroom technology. 

We suggest that you take advantage of updated documentation on the 
ClassTech website and in the ITS cabinets.  Brief video clips on using 
the equipment in individual classrooms are now available from the web 
pages for those classrooms.  You can use the video clips at your own pace 
and at your convenience.  (Hands-on training will continue to be 
available for those who request it).

To see the documentation, go to www.cites.uiuc.edu/classtech and click on 
the link for ""Help"" in the left-hand navigation.

To see descriptions and images of ITS classrooms and the new video clips, 
click on the link for ""Classrooms"" in the left-hand navigation and then 
click on the particular classroom of interest.

To acquire the access codes, classroom users will still need to request 
them through our website.  Click on the link for ""Training and Code 
Request,"" in the left-hand navigation, complete the form and the code 
will be e-mailed to you, usually within a few hours.

Dear Colleagues:

	Forty-three years ago a young Stukel family spent our first 
holiday season in the warm embrace of the University of Illinois. It was 
a special time and place for us. Our future was uncertain, but we were 
sure this University was a good place with good people doing important 
work.
	Four decades later as Joan and I prepare to set sail--
figuratively and literally--to retirement, we send holiday greetings to 
our U. of I. family for the last time. We know that although much has 
changed over the years, the fundamental strength of this great University 
remains: good people doing exceptional work.
	In the last several months we have had the pleasure of visiting 
and reminiscing with many of you about the decade of what I call ""our 
presidency,"" meaning all of us at the U. of I. Each campus has a special 
significance for the University, and for Joan and me. We deeply 
appreciate the kind send-offs and will keep you in our thoughts.
	I am sure your welcome to the 16th president, B. Joseph White, 
and his wife Mary will be equally warm and heartfelt. Joe has a record of 
leadership and accomplishment, and I am confident the Board of Trustees 
made a sound decision in choosing him to lead the University. Joe and 
Mary have made numerous visits to the campuses in the five weeks since 
his selection was announced, and they are eager to officially join the U. 
of I. family on Feb. 1.
	Joe has the same belief in the value of public higher education 
and commitment to keeping it strong as all of us at the University of 
Illinois. Our University and its three campuses stand as one of the 
world's finest institutions of higher learning, research and public 
service. Because of the exceptional job all of you do in fulfilling those 
missions, as well as the University's role as an economic engine, the U. 
of I. is an irreplaceable jewel for the State of Illinois.
	I think about how different the world would be if public 
universities weren't providing affordable, accessible higher education 
for eight out of 10 college students; if the results of our research 
weren't saving lives and improving standards of living; and if our public 
engagement wasn't responding to societal needs and cultural appetites. It 
would be a world unimaginably poor in many respects. And I reflect on the 
impossibility of leading the U. of I. without the spirit and dedication 
of the faculty and staff.
	Again, thank you for your good work. I wish you a peaceful and 
joyful holiday season and a healthy and happy new year. 

Sincerely,

James J. Stukel
President

Re:    December Holiday Schedule

I am pleased to inform you that President Stukel and the Chancellors are 
granting two gift half-days on December 30 to complement the previously 
announced holiday time off for our faculty and staff during the upcoming 
holiday period.  In addition, Tuesday, December 28 and Wednesday, December 
29 will be designated as reduced services days.  The holiday period 
calendar can be viewed at http://www.oc.uiuc.edu/holiday_2004.  The 
University will not be officially closed and essential services will be 
provided.  However, offices will not be open for business and there will 
be no academic or student events.

The two reduced service days are not holidays, and you are asked to use 
accrued vacation or floating holidays to cover these two days.  If you are 
an academic or civil service staff member and wish to work during the 
reduced service days, please discuss suitable arrangements with your 
supervisor.  Hourly (nonexempt civil service) employees not using vacation 
or floating holidays to cover this period may take time without pay or use 
accrued compensatory time.  Nonexempt civil service employees who are 
required to work or who choose to work the reduced service days or the 
gift half-days will receive their regular hourly rate of pay.

Wednesday, December 29 is a payday for civil service employees.  Those who 
receive paper checks will be able to pick them up at a central location 
that day.  Information about the location and hours of operation will be 
disseminated to employees as soon as it becomes available.

If you are a civil service staff member and have questions concerning the 
reduced services period please contact Corbin Smith, Manager of Labor and 
Employee Relations, Personnel Services Office, at 333-3105 or 
cjsmith1@uillinois.edu.  Academic staff members should contact Debi Stone, 
Associate Director, Academic Human Resources Office, at 333-6747 or 
debstone@uiuc.edu.

I know that this past year has been difficult as we implemented a complex 
software system and coped with the accompanying process changes.  All of 
you have risen admirably to the challenges, and we appreciate the 
extraordinary efforts you have made.  Please know that the campus is in

 Subject: MASSMAIL - STUDENT VOTER INFORMATION","WHEN TO VOTE:  
Election Day is tomorrow, Tuesday, November 2, 2004.
Polling places are open from 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.
 
Since voting may take longer than you expect, be prepared to face a wait. 
Show up early just in case. If you are in line at the polling place 
before closing time at 7 pm, you will be allowed to vote, even if 
everyone is not able to vote until after 7 pm.
 
SAMPLE BALLOT:
A sample ballot is available online at: 
http://www.champaigncountyclerk.com/fullspecimen.pdf
 
WHAT TO BRING: 
When you go to the polling place make sure you have two things that have 
your name and local address:
 
One of these two things must be one of the following:
Bank statement
Utility bill
Paycheck
Government refund check


Any government document showing your name and address, this includes 
anything you may have received from the University of Illinois 
 
If you live in the University Residence Halls, you can get a Move-In 
Notice as proof of your address from:
 
University Housing
100 Clark Hall
1203 S. Fourth St.
Champaign, IL 61820
 
If you registered by mail, through a registration kiosk, or by Motor 
Voter, you are required to present ID. It is possible to check whether or 
not you will be required to show ID due to how you registered by checking 
your voter registration status here, as well as your designated polling 
place: https://www.champaigncountyclerk.com/registrationstatus.asp 
 
Even if you are not listed as having to show ID to vote, it is better to 
be prepared in the event of complications.
 
WHERE TO VOTE: 
Follow this link if you aren't sure where your local polling place is:
http://www.champaigncountyclerk.com/registrationstatus.asp
 
WHAT IF YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO VOTE:
Regardless of what happens, you should be able to cast a provisional 
ballot. Even if your vote is successfully challenged, your name is not on 
the list of registered voters, or you are not able to present proper 
identification, you should still be able to cast a provisional ballot as 
a last resort. When you cast such a ballot, you should be informed how to 
resolve the complication that prevented you from voting, which you will 
likely be required to do within the next day or two.
 
If you feel that your right to vote has been violated, you should 
immediately contact your local election authority, the local States 
Attorneys office, or the Federal Election Commission. 

Additionally, if you believe you are unjustly kept from voting or if 
there is an unreasonable delay at your polling place, we encourage you to 
contact the local media to tell your story. The Daily Illini newsroom can 
be reached at 337-8351, the News-Gazette newsroom can be reached 351-5252.
 
QUESTIONS:
If you have any questions or concerns regarding voting
you can contact the Champaign County Clerk at 384-3720.

at 
 
The survey takes less than 2 minutes to complete.  Many of 
the instructional cuts next year will be determined by the 
amount of next year's tuition increase, so it is very 
important that you vote and that student opinion be heard on this 
issue.  Results of the survey will be presented to the 
University Administration and Board of Trustees.  This is 
your way to let them know how much you value the quality of 
your education at the U of I.  Information on the website 
describes the possible levels of tuition increase and their 
impact on instructional services. 

Current Freshmen will not receive an increase in tuition due 
to the Truth in Tuition Act through the State of Illinois.  
Out-of-state students traditionally receive a tuition 
increase that amounts to approximately three times the in-state tuition 
increase.  Please take these into account when 
completing the survey.

TO:	UIUC Senators, Deans, Directors, Faculty and Staff

RE:	Nominations for Honorary Degrees for May 2006 Commencements

The Senate Committee on Honorary Degrees is pleased to invite nominations 
for the May 2006 honorary degree awards.  Nomination procedures are 
detailed below.  You are urged to nominate, through your unit (department, 
school, college, etc.), outstanding candidates for Honorary Degree 
awards.  

The committee requests that nominations and supporting materials for the 
May 2006 commencement be submitted by November 15, 2004.  All previously 
submitted candidates not recommended to the Senate at this time will be 
considered by the Committee as 2006 candidates.  The Committee urges all 
units contemplating submitting a nomination to begin their preparation as 
soon as possible.  Please note that in order to maintain absolute 
confidentiality and avoid possible embarrassment to the candidate and to 
the University in case of lack of approval, under no circumstances is any 
potential candidate to be contacted even to obtain lists of references 
and/or vitae.  You may contact her/his secretary, colleague, etc., swear 
the person to absolute secrecy and obtain such a list. Please use only non 
University of Illinois persons for references.  Only the President and/or 
Chancellor may contact candidates.

The Committee appreciates your help in identifying outstanding individuals 
whom the University can honor and, in so doing, honor itself.  If you have 
any questions or need additional information, please contact the Senate 
Office (333-6805).  For your convenience, a nomination form is at: 
http://www.uiuc.edu/providers/senate/hd_form.html


REQUEST FOR NOMINATIONS FOR HONORARY DEGREES

The prime, controlling consideration should be distinction.  The person 
should have made a distinguished contribution to knowledge and creativity 
in the relevant field of endeavor, and have shown sustained activity of 
uncommon merit.  The contributions may be made in a wide range of 
activities; the following list is not exhaustive:

- Scholarship, in any discipline:  major breakthroughs in knowledge in 
fields of scholarly work.
- Creative Arts, in the broad sense of the term:  literature, music, 
architecture, engineering, et al; the development of new frontiers of 
creativity.
- Professions:  distinguished contributions, innovative work of 
distinction.
- Public Service:  outstanding achievement in statesmanship, 
administration, legislative activity, the judiciary, or in non-govermental 
civic activities.
- Business, Industry and Labor:  outstanding, innovative activity in the 
business and/or labor community.

Following Senate guidelines http://www.uiuc.edu/unit/senate/criteria.html, 
the Committee will consider, but not be bound by, the degree to which the 
candidate has had some association with Illinois - the University or the 
State.  While alumni of the University should not be excluded, honorary 
degrees are not a means of recognizing their contributions; other awards 
exist for this purpose.  Current administrators, faculty, or staff of the 
University ordinarily are not eligible; while emeriti are eligible even if 
engaged in teaching or research at the University.  Elected officials of 
the State of Illinois and its subordinate units and members of the 
Legislature, during their terms of office, ordinarily are not eligible.

Senate guidelines emphasize recommendations by departments and other 
academic units.  A nomination coming to the Committee from a member of the 
Board of Trustees, an alumnus/alumna or friend of the University, will be 
referred to the proper academic unit for support of the faculty.

For full consideration by the Committee, the nominator or nominating unit 
should supply the following information to the Committee by November 15, 
2004:

1.     A brief letter of nomination, summarizing the candidate's 
qualifications for this honor, and certifying the support of the 
appropriate academic unit.

2.     A brief curriculum vitae of the nominee, including addresses, 
telephone numbers, or other means by which the nominee can be reached.  If 
the nomination finds substantial initial support in the Honorary Degrees 
Committee, additional information may be requested from the department to 
develop the case and to provide the Senate with the materials it needs for 
the final decision.

3.     The names and addresses of at least four professionally-
distinguished individuals who could be contacted for letters of support or 
further information about the candidate.  It is hoped that oral 
communications among professional colleagues will help assure the 
confidentiality of the decision process.

Nominations and full dossiers should be marked confidential and sent to 
the Committee on Honorary Degrees, c/o Senate Office, 228 English 
Building, MC-461.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Fall Semester Bill","Dear Graduate Student,

This mailing is intended for graduate students, mostly those with 
assistantships or fellowships, who are eligible for a waiver of tuition 
and the service fee and, in many instances, a credit against the costs of 
health coverage. 

If you belong in that group, your fall semester bill, which will be sent 
out the first week of September, might not yet reflect credits and waivers 
to cover tuition and the service fee or costs of health coverage. When the 
credits become available, they will be applied to your student account. We 
expect these credits and waivers to be finalized before the October 
statement. However, if they are not applied prior to the October 
statement, some late fees may result.  

You will not need to pay any late fee assessed because of this process. If 
you find you have been assessed a fee because of this situation, please 
notify studentaccounts@uiuc.edu so that the late fee may be canceled.  

If you have been awarded a student loan, you may find that money from that 
loan has been applied to the tuition and fees normally covered by these 
waivers and credits.   

In that case, you will be eligible for a short-term loan of up to 
$1,000.00. Loan application forms are available in the Office of Student 
Financial Aid.  

You will be able to confirm when your waiver is updated and the 
disbursement has posted to your account.  

The following site will provide you with up-to-date status information 
about your student account: https://ui-integrate.apps.uillinois.edu/.  
Select Account Billing Information and then Student Account Summary by 
Term.  

On behalf of the University, I apologize for the inconvenience caused you 
by these credits not being applied to your account in a timely manner.   
Please be assured that every effort is being made to update your account. 
We will issue an additional communication in mid-September to provide a 
status report on our efforts.

Dear Faculty Colleague,

The Bylaws of the Senate, Part A 6., state: The Senate shall call an 
annual meeting of the faculty of the campus to hear reports from and to 
question the Senate Executive Committee and the administration.

This year, the Annual Meeting of the Faculty will take place on Monday, 
September 20, at 3:10 PM in Illini Room C of the Illini Union. You will 
have a rather unique opportunity not only to hear from two key university 
and campus administrators but also to talk with them, both in a discussion 
period during the meeting itself and informally afterward.

At the meeting this year, President James Stukel and Interim Chancellor 
Richard Herman will deliver remarks, after which there will be an open 
discussion session during which your questions and comments will be 
welcome. They regard this meeting as an important occasion, and intend to 
use it to good effect. They will give you their sense of where we stand, 
what we are up against, and what is to be done; and they will be 
interested in hearing from you, both on the matters they mention and on 
others. 

The Annual Meeting of the Faculty can and should serve as a forum for a 
discussion of issues affecting all of us, to which both administrators and 
faculty contribute. We hope that you will join us at the meeting this 
year.  After its conclusion, there will be a reception in the South Lounge 
of the Illini Union, sponsored by the Chancellor, at which discussion can 
continue informally. 

We look forward to seeing you at this meeting.

Cordially,

Dear Colleagues,

I write to update you on the selection process for the next president of 
the University.  Earlier this summer the consultative committee submitted 
to the board the white paper defining the challenges and opportunities 
for the next president and the qualities that the chief executive officer 
should bring to the position.  The board approved the white paper on June 
17, 2004.   The position description along with invitations for 
nominations and applications were announced in national and international 
media and specialized higher education publications during June and 
July.  Announcements were also made in the alumni magazines and in 
newsletters to the University community.  Over 300 university presidents 
and chancellors also received a letter from the committee.  

As a result of our outreach efforts we have received a number of 
nominations and continue to receive nominations and applications every 
day.  Baker-Parker, an executive search firm, is following up on each 
nomination to develop a pool of well qualified candidates. The committee 
will begin its work of reviewing and prioritizing potential candidates in 
early September.  If there are potential candidates you would like to 
nominate, we encourage you to do so soon by way of the presidential 
search website http://www.uillinois.edu/presidentsearch/index.html.  The 
website also contains a copy of the white paper and position announcement.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - A Message from the President","July 26, 2004

Dear Colleagues:

Last Saturday night when the Illinois General Assembly's record overtime 
session gaveled to a close, we welcomed the fact that our state support 
for the fiscal year that began July 1 is at the same level as last year. 
A state budget that provides the same taxpayer funding for Fiscal Year 
2005 as it did for FY 04 is reason to be grateful since Illinois, like 
other states, has continuing financial stresses and strains.

The FY 05 state appropriation to the University of Illinois puts an end 
to three consecutive years of reductions and rescissions. We believe this 
demonstrates that our state universities and community colleges--which 
educate the vast majority of Illinois students--are priorities for 
legislators and the governor.

The state appropriation to the university from general revenue funds is 
about $697 million for our day-to-day operations. Along with student 
tuition, this critical money pays most of our faculty and staff salaries 
and wages; heats, cools, and lights our buildings; puts books in the 
libraries; and equips our classrooms and instructional labs. It is, in 
short, the underlying foundation for our central work of teaching and 
outreach.

The General Assembly and the governor, however, left undecided until the 
November session the state's capital, or building, program, which is 
typically paid for with long-term revenue bonds the state sells on the 
open market; we'll let you know more on that as the news unfolds. Our 
first capital priority is always repair and renovation of existing 
facilities on our three campuses, and we eagerly await good news on that 
front.

Other parts of the state budget sustained cuts--as much as 4 percent--
while higher education did not. We deeply appreciate this recognition by 
state lawmakers and the governor of how important public higher education 
is to the vitality and economic well-being of Illinois, as well as 
acknowledging the previous sacrifices our state universities have made to 
help manage the Illinois budget crisis.

By maintaining state support at a steady level and reaping the benefits 
of our 25 percent reduction in administrative costs, the University of 
Illinois can now focus on preserving the already high quality of our core 
missions of teaching, research, public service, and economic development.

I encourage you to mail or call your legislators--and the governor's 
office--to  thank them on behalf of the people of Illinois for helping to 
preserve one of the state's great assets, the University of Illinois.

I believe we have turned the corner on the budget, but these have been 
extraordinarily difficult years. For your support, patience, and 
goodwill, I give you my personal thanks.

Dear Colleagues:


            As you very likely know, discussions are continuing among the
Governor and Legislative leaders over the state's budget for the new fiscal
year which will begin this Thursday, July 1st.  We remain hopeful that
those discussions will be successful and that an operating budget for all
state-supported activities, including funding for the University of
Illinois, will be established soon.  
 
            This week the General Assembly may consider providing funds for
a brief period of time at the beginning of the new fiscal year if final
resolution has not been reached on the full budget.  Those funds would be
made available to agencies without any other resources on which to draw for
continuing operations.
 
            In the absence of new state appropriations, the University has
sufficient tuition resources to meet all state-supported payroll
obligations through the month of July.  We will utilize those resources as
necessary to cover state-supported payrolls due this month.   At their
request, we conveyed this information to legislative appropriations
committees during the last part of June, to assist in their deliberations

students, employs more than 23,000 full-time faculty and staff, has 
550,000 living alumni, and has an annual budget of $3.3 billion.

Nominations, applications, and expressions of interest are being

 Subject: MASSMAIL - A Letter from the President","June 8, 2004

Dear Colleagues:

Normally by now I would have delivered my year-end greetings and 
summarized the state legislative session. Although our academic year 
wound up successfully and on time, the legislature is working past its 
scheduled and statutory adjournment dates.

So let me report on what I know for now, and I will get back to you when 
the state's budget for the coming fiscal year is resolved.

One thing I know for sure is this was a tremendous year of accomplishment 
for the University of Illinois, notwithstanding the budget constraints we 
have been dealt in the past several years.

It doesn't get much better than having two faculty members honored as 
Nobel Prize laureates, which is precisely what happened on successive 
days last October when chemist Paul Lauterbur and physicist Anthony 
Leggett were recognized by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for 
their respective work.

The lift in pride and morale was palpable across the Urbana-Champaign 
campus that sunny autumn week. Professors Leggett and Lauterbur might be 
the most famous faculty for now, but they were not alone in receiving 
awards and recognition this year. Microbiologist Carl Woese took home the 
Craaford Prize in Biosciences, also bestowed by the Royal Swedish 
Academy, and physicist-inventor Nick Holonyak received the National Medal 
of Technology and the Lemelson-MIT Prize. Colleagues and students at all 
three campuses are being honored for excellence and achievement. We are 
all about quality; it is what this university provides the people of 
Illinois.

I am constantly, pleasantly reminded of the exceptional talent of our 
faculty and students; of the breadth of research, instruction, and public 
service occurring statewide under the University of Illinois banner; and 
of the dedication of our staff in support of the university's mission. 
The fact that the University of Illinois continues to excel with less 
state assistance is a testament to the hard work and resourcefulness of 
each one of you. For that, I am most thankful.

While our academic enterprise flourished, our campuses continued to 
transform themselves through expansion, new facilities, and relationships 
with the communities we serve. We continue to plan, to grow, and to build 
for the future.

A pretty good year, after all, considering the impact of the state's 
fiscal condition on public higher education. Of course, we are concerned 
about the fiscal impacts and the risk to our quality and forward momentum 
if state support continues to erode.

As you may know, the governor's budget office asked public universities 
to return 2 percent of state appropriations for the fiscal year ending 
June 30. The May 12 action came at the conclusion of our academic year 
and was in addition to an 8 percent cut in the University of Illinois 
appropriation for fiscal year 2004. Now, the legislature is deliberating 
options for a fiscal year 2005 budget. The governor's plan would cut our 
FY05 appropriation by another 2 percent, while a recommendation by the 
Illinois Board of Higher Education would maintain the same level of 
funding as the FY04 appropriation. We favor the IBHE plan in hopes of 
restoring some of the academic programs lost to cuts in the past two 
years. Again, I will update you on the legislature's final actions and 
the expected impacts on the University of Illinois.

Finally, this year was one of transition. Several highly valued 
academicians and administrators announced they would leave this summer 
for opportunities at other colleges and universities, including UIUC 
Chancellor Nancy Cantor, who will become president of Syracuse 
University. I wish all of them the best, and they will always remain 
members of the University of Illinois's extended family.

Joan and I announced we are headed toward retirement next January, after 
43 years with the university, and so commencements this spring were 
bittersweet. A search to find the 16th president of the University of 
Illinois is under way, and I expect a smooth transition in the next 
academic year. Meantime, there is work to be done (e.g., the unfinished 
business of a budget) and I look forward to working with you in the next 
six months to meet the challenges and maintain our place as one of the 
great universities in the world.

As always, Joan and I wish you a safe, pleasant, and renewing summer.

Sincerely,

James J. Stukel

Dear Colleagues:


	As if this year hasn't thrown enough challenges at us, the 
University of Illinois became aware of a new one this week with an 
unexpected announcement that the state of Illinois plans to end the long-
standing participation of the Health Alliance HMO in the state's health 
insurance program.

	We have communicated to the state's Department of Central 
Management Services (CMS) that this decision is a concern for many of our 
employees and for the University of Illinois, and we have encouraged a 
review by CMS of the decision to drop Health Alliance. Also, on Monday, 
May 3, a hearing on this matter will be held by the Illinois House State 
Government Committee and U. of I. staff will be on hand to provide 
information and respond to questions about the impact of this action on 
our employees.

	If the decision stands and Health Alliance HMO is discontinued 
from the health insurance program, human resource advisers will be 
available to work with employees to weigh their options during the 
upcoming benefit choice period of May and June.

	Nearly 7,000 active University of Illinois employees at our 
campuses in Chicago, Springfield and Urbana-Champaign currently receive 
their health care insurance coverage through the Health Alliance program. 
Sixty percent of those employees also insure at least one dependent, and 
countless U. of I. retirees and dependents are Health Alliance members. 
Moreover, Carle Clinic and Carle Foundation Hospital are major health 
care institutions in the Urbana-Champaign community, and employees might 
have deep and long-standing relationships with Carle physicians and 
medical facilities through Health Alliance.

	As I have communicated on several occasions in recent years, the 
U. of I. understands the constrained fiscal circumstances confronting the 
state and understands the need to make state-provided benefit programs 
cost-effective. At the same time, we are asking those making decisions 
about health care coverage for all state employees to look carefully at 
the full-cost picture and the impact of each prospective program.

University administrators are in contact with Health Alliance and CMS 
officials to discuss the issue.  Officials with Health Alliance are

Re: Faculty Nominations for Chancellor Search Committee


Following the announcement of the impending departure of Chancellor Cantor 
from our campus, the Senate Executive Committee received the approval of 
the President to solicit nominations for a ""Search Committee to Advise the 
President on the Selection of a Chancellor"". 

In accord with procedures approved by the Senate on March 29, 2004, the 
Search Committee will consist of one faculty chair, eight additional 
faculty, three students, one dean or director, one academic professional, 
and one staff member. 

The Urbana-Champaign Senate will consider and vote on nominations from all 
of the above constituencies at its regular meeting at 3:10 p.m. in 
Foellinger Auditorium on April 26, 2004. In order to facilitate that 
process, the Senate Executive Committee has asked the Committee on 
Committees to identify 12 to 14 faculty who are willing to serve. (The 
Committee on Committees will also solicit nominations from the appropriate 
bodies for the other constituencies.) Nominations may also be made from 
the floor, but must be accompanied by an agreement to serve from the 
nominee. 

Therefore, we ask that faculty nominate members for the Search Committee; 
faculty may also self-nominate.  Brief letters of nomination of those who 
represent the diverse perspectives of the University are welcomed. 

Please send names of nominees via campus mail or email by 12:00 noon on

Dear Colleagues:

It is a pleasure to inform you of my intention to recommend Provost 
Richard Herman to serve as interim chancellor of the University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign upon the departure of Chancellor Nancy 
Cantor to her new post at Syracuse University.

The University of Illinois is fortunate to have someone of Dr. Herman's 
stature and experience to call upon at such a time, making the transition 
to new campus leadership the smoothest possible. Richard has been provost 
and vice chancellor for academic affairs at UIUC since 1998 and as such 
is familiar to most around campus in his role as chief academic and 
budget officer.

A widely published mathematician and scientist, Dr. Herman came to UIUC 
from the University of Maryland, where he served for eight years as dean 
of the College of Computer, Mathematical, and Physical Sciences. Prior to 
his work at Maryland, Richard served for four years at the Pennsylvania 
State University as chair of the Department of Mathematics. (To learn 
more, go to www.provost.uiuc.edu/provost/provost.html).

Richard's administrative experience has served him and the U. of I. well. 
During his tenure as provost, Richard has worked with Nancy Cantor and 
former chancellor Michael Aiken to preserve UIUC's worldwide reputation 
for academic excellence in a period of fiscal crisis for the state and 
the university. Among his many accomplishments, Richard has overseen 
programs to raise the quality of UIUC's faculty and students; played a 
major role in tuition and student fee policy; and strategically allocated 
resources to strengthen the core missions of the university. Dr. Herman 
is highly respected by those who know him, both on and off campus.

I intend to submit my recommendation to appoint Dr. Herman as interim 
chancellor of UIUC at the next Board of Trustees meeting. This 
appointment comes at an important time for the University of Illinois, a 
period of transition in which strong, stable leadership is essential. As 
you know, I will retire at the end of this year after nearly a decade as 
president, and Nancy Cantor will depart this summer to become president 
and chancellor of Syracuse University.

Richard Herman will provide a steady hand on the tiller to ensure UIUC 
stays on course during the months to come. Please join me in wishing him 
the best and in offering him our support.

General Assembly of the State of Illinois, requires each officer and 
employee of all state agencies and universities to complete an ethics 
training program annually beginning in 2004.
 
We are currently evaluating several options for our employees to satisfy 
this new annual requirement. Our goal is to provide several alternatives 
which will be communicated to you and posted on the Ethics web site 
(http://ethics.uillinois.edu) as they become available.

Two options for compliance with the training requirement currently 
available are:

o	The web-based Ethics Training program located in NESSIE at 
https://nessie.uihr.uillinois.edu/cf/policies/index.cfm?Item_id=2314.  The 
web-based program will also be accessible in the NESSIE New Hire task list 
as an option for new hires. The program takes about 30 minutes to complete 
and cross references ethics situations to University policy. Upon 
completion of the program, credit is automatically recorded for completing 
the Ethics Training requirement for the year 2004.
 
o	Another option is to attend the training class Ethics in the 
Workplace, which will be conducted on each campus. This class is currently 
scheduled for May 5, 2004, in Urbana, and training dates will be scheduled 
soon in Chicago and Springfield. Registration can be submitted by 
accessing the Ethics web site http://ethics.uillinois.edu .

For those who have already completed our web-based course, please notify

Dear Colleagues:

It is the time of year when we turn our attention to the state capital 
and the level of public financial support we can expect for the coming 
year from the governor and state legislature.

Governor Blagojevich presented his budget plan for Fiscal Year 2005 last 
week, and I will resume my meetings with lawmakers in Springfield this 
week. My visits to the statehouse this spring will include testimony on 
behalf of the university to appropriations committees in March and April. 
The legislative schedule calls for final action on the state's $43.5 
billion budget by the end of May.

Unfortunately, public higher education is an area of state funding 
recommended for a reduction again as Illinois's economic climate remains 
weak, and the governor's office projects a $1.7 billion deficit for the 
coming fiscal year, which begins July l.

The governor has proposed a Fiscal Year 2005 budget for Illinois public 
universities that is 1.9 percent lower than the appropriation for the 
current fiscal year. For the University of Illinois, the recommendation 
is $682.9 million, a reduction of $13.9 million, or 2 percent, from the 
university's state appropriation for Fiscal Year 2004. In addition, other 
reductions in statewide grant programs will have a negative impact on 
students and faculty on all three campuses. The governor's 
recommendations on capital projects spending will be issued in March.

As we know all too well, this represents the third year in a row of state 
funding cuts for the U of I and the state's other public universities. If 
there is a silver lining--a sign perhaps of a moderately improving 
economy--it is that this reduction is significantly smaller than those in 
each of the previous two fiscal years.

Some confusion arose last week when budget data was presented in 
Springfield showing ""all funds"" resources for public universities, not 
just state general revenue funds. Thus, including revenue from tuition, 
research, fees, auxiliaries, endowment earnings, etc.--in addition to our 
state funds--may have left some with the impression our funding had 
increased.

Yes, revenue from those important additional sources has risen and helped 
offset the impact of state funding reductions. But the bottom line is: 
those funds are not interchangeable with state dollars, which support our 
core salaries and operations, and we have experienced declining state 
support in a period of economic crisis.

As the legislative budgetary process unfolds, I will be working closely 
with leadership from each of the campuses to make a clear and convincing 
case for the needs of our faculty, students, and staff. I will keep you 
apprised of our progress and invite you to stay abreast of the process by 
connecting to my Web site, www.uillinois.edu/president/.

Dear Colleagues:


Nancy Cantor has provided outstanding leadership for the Urbana-Champaign 
campus and positioned the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 
the vanguard of higher education's multidisciplinary approach to 
teaching, research, and public engagement.

In order to fulfill those three fundamental missions, the best 
universities continually engage in creative and resourceful new ways to 
learn, to teach, and to prepare young adults to become leaders of future 
generations.  Nancy's cross-campus, interdisciplinary initiatives on the 
Urbana-Champaign campus have made it a national model for how 
universities will serve America in the twenty-first century.

In addition to being a dynamic and forward-looking national spokeswoman 
for the U of I and American higher education, Nancy has been a passionate 
advocate for the Urbana-Champaign campus, its faculty, staff, and 
students.  Despite successive cuts in state support to the university 
during her tenure, Nancy and her team managed to enhance the quality and 
stature of the Urbana-Champaign campus. As I often remark, Nancy might be 
petite, but her energy and resourcefulness are boundless.

While I am disappointed to see her leave so soon, and with so much 
promise left in her agenda, we all recognize this is a tremendous 
opportunity for Nancy as she rises to the next plateau in her profession. 
Syracuse University is fortunate to have her as its chancellor and to 
continue to build on the tradition of excellence established under 
Chancellor Kenneth Shaw.

Please join me in wishing Nancy and her husband, Steve Brechin, and their 
children, Maddy and Archie, the best of luck, success, and happiness.

Dear Colleagues and Friends, 

I apologize for this impersonal way of telling you, but I wanted you to 
know that I have decided to leave the University of Illinois in July to 
become Chancellor and President of Syracuse University.  The trustees at 
Syracuse wanted to be the first to break the news, and they asked me to 
be in Syracuse today when their chairman made the announcement.  I will 
return home to Urbana on Sunday.  

Syracuse is giving me a wonderful opportunity to lead a great 
university.  As a native New Yorker, I think Syracuse and I will be a 
good fit.  Still, it was very difficult to make the decision to leave 
Illinois.

My three years with you have gone too quickly.   I feel gratified by the 
progress we have made together in continuing to move forward in 
imaginative and successful ways, even in the face of difficult economic 
times.  I am confident that Illinois will continue to lead the nation in 
many aspects of science, technology, and engineering, and I am delighted 
with the opportunities we have had to enhance our programs in the arts, 
the social sciences, and the humanities. I have high hopes for our Cross 
Campus initiatives, our strong commitments to community engagement, and 
the plans to preserve and expand our wonderful library. 

As you might guess, I am deeply thankful for the efforts that so many of 
you have made to make this campus even more diverse and more in touch 
with the needs of its many constituencies. It has been an honor and a 
pleasure to know and work with you. 

In the months to come, I promise to do everything I can to help the 
university continue in its success and to ease the transition for my 
successor. 

Cordially,

Nancy

Dear Colleagues:

Nothing worth having comes easy. I am reminded of this every time the 
subject of Banner comes up.

Banner, or UI-Integrate, our universitywide information systems upgrade, 
is an ambitious and complex undertaking that will pay dividends well into 
the future. The new system allows the university to operate more 
efficiently--an important factor in this era of tight budgets--and scraps 
a patchwork of obsolete subsystems that are expensive to maintain and at 
risk of failure.

But it hasn't been easy, as we all can attest.

I, too, have experienced a ""Banner moment"" on occasion--puzzlement and 
frustration when stymied by a function. To those for whom this has been a 
regular occurrence as we climbed the learning curve of Banner's 
implementation, please accept my gratitude for your patience and hard 
work. The success of UI-Integrate would not be possible without the time 
and effort of faculty and especially staff who learned to use a new 
system on a challenging timetable.

The UI-Integrate project team has kept us on schedule for completion in 
June 2005, and they have stayed on budget. Our most critical business and 
human resource functions, including payroll, have come online, and 
student information systems are next. Yes, there have been glitches, and 
hindsight indicates a more benign schedule for implementation might have 
been preferable. Overall, though, a resourceful project team and a legion 
of university employees who work with the system daily have gotten us 
over hump after hump.

My sincerest thanks to all who have labored so hard to make UI-Integrate 
a reality. There remains work ahead to complete the task, and I remain 
confident the benefits will be well worth the effort. To learn more about 
UI-Integrate, go to the project Web site: www.ui-integrate@uillinois.edu.

And, again, thank you.

From: Senate Committee on Committees 
Date: January 27, 2004 
Re: Faculty Nominations for Consultative Committee to Assist in the 
Selection of a President

Following the retirement announcement of President Stukel, the University 
Senates Conference and the Senate Executive Committee have communicated 
with the Board of Trustees about procedures to be used in the search for a 
new President. 

If precedent holds, the Consultative Committee to Assist in the Selection 
of a President will consist of twelve faculty (four from each campus), 
three students (one from each campus), one faculty member at large who 
will serve as Chair of the Committee, one member of the support staff, one 
member of the academic professional staff, four administrative officers of 
the University, one representative of the Alumni Association, and one 
representative of the University of Illinois Foundation. The Senates of 
each campus have been asked to nominate twice the number of faculty and 
student members to be selected and University Senates Conference has been 
asked to draw from these slates in order to recommend those who will serve.

The Urbana-Champaign Senate will consider faculty and student nominations 
at its regular meeting at 3:10 p.m. in Foellinger Auditorium on February 
16, 2004, to elect eight faculty and two student nominees. In order to 
facilitate that process, the Senate Executive Committee has asked the 
Committee on Committees to identify twelve faculty and four students who 
are willing to serve. Nominations may also be made from the floor, but 
must be accompanied by an agreement to serve from the nominee.

Therefore, we ask that the campus community nominate faculty and student 
members for the Consultative Committee.  Faculty may also self-nominate.  
Brief letters of nomination of those who represent the diverse 
perspectives of the University are welcomed. 

Please send names of nominees via campus mail or email by 12:00 noon on 
January 29, 2004 to:

Dear Colleagues:

I write today to tell you I have informed the Board of Trustees that I 
will retire as president of the University of Illinois effective February 
1, 2005.

I credit all of you with making this a wonderful and satisfying 
experience, both personally and professionally. But after nine years of 
leading this great university, it is a good time to make a change.

Joan and I have been members of the U. of I. family for 42 years and will 
continue that relationship in our retirement. Beginning with graduate 
school in 1961, we have been privileged to be associated with the 
university in many capacities.

After graduate school at the Urbana-Champaign campus, my career in higher 
education was launched in the College of Engineering and progressed 
through a series of faculty and administrative posts in the college and 
at the campus.

The professional horizon broadened in the ensuing decade, and from 1985 
to 1995 we participated in a remarkable period of growth and 
transformation for the Chicago campus. It was an exciting time, 
culminating with a term as chancellor, in which the university overhauled 
the campus's research agenda, initiated the signature Great Cities 
program, and launched the South Campus development, which is reenergizing 
a historic neighborhood.

Since 1995, I have been honored to serve as president. It has been an 
eventful nine years. Because of the dedication and hard work of faculty, 
staff, and administrators and the careful stewardship of trustees, the 
University of Illinois is bigger, better, and stronger.

Together we have significantly expanded the university's engagement with 
the society we serve; continued to offer affordable educational programs 
of international stature to undergraduate, graduate, and professional 
students; and, in spite of historically difficult economic times 
recently, made major improvements in the quality of key educational 
programs through strategic investments in people, research, and 
scholarship. We completely restructured our administrative organization 
and welcomed the Springfield campus as a new member of the university.

By next February, I will have served a total of 14 1/2 years as chief 
executive officer at both the campus level and for the University of 
Illinois. These years have been wonderful. Joan and I thank the entire 
University of Illinois family--faculty, students, staff, alumni, and 
friends of the university--for its invaluable support.

We also have had the pleasure of working with trustees on initiatives 
that made positive impacts on the university. I am grateful for their 
generous contributions of personal time and resources in support of these 
initiatives and for their wise counsel in dealing with the many 
challenges encountered along the way.

I also thank the leadership and staff of the University of Illinois 
Alumni Association and the University of Illinois Foundation for their 
support and friendship and the skill and persuasiveness they bring to the 
important role of friend- and fund-raising.

I look forward to working with the Board of Trustees, leadership of the 
campuses, administration, and faculty in the coming year because as 
always we have much to do. And I will look forward, with fond memories, 
to following the continued greatness of the University of Illinois.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Vacation Accrual for Civil Service Employees","TO:    Civil Service Employees

FROM:  Denise Hendricks, Assistant Vice President for Human Resources

Since the implementation of the Banner system, many of you have had 
questions regarding the benefits accrual process.  I would like to take 
this opportunity to give you a more detailed explanation of how your 
benefits accrue under the new system.

With the previous Paymaster system, vacation and sick leave usage was 
subtracted before newly accrued benefit hours were added.  With Banner, 
accrued benefit hours are added before benefit usage is subtracted.  As 
you know, there is no cap on the amount of sick leave employees can 
accrue.  Therefore, this difference in sequencing in the new payroll 
system does not affect sick leave balances.  However, there are caps on 
vacation balances.  Employees who are at or near their maximum vacation 
balances must use sufficient vacation each pay period in order to remain 
below their caps or they will not accrue any or some part of the vacation 
benefits they have earned in that pay period.  

At the time of Banner implementation, units and employees were not aware 
of the change in benefits accrual sequencing and did not have an 
opportunity to make accommodations for those at or near their accrual 
maximums.  As a result, some employees did not accrue vacation.  So that 
affected employees are not disadvantaged by this lack of preparation, 
units have been instructed to maintain a special record of the number of 
vacation hours employees did not accrue for the first two pay periods in 
Banner (December 21, 2003 ? January 3, 2004 and January 4, 2004 ? January 
17, 2004).

*****
Example:  Employee has a balance of 395 hours of vacation and has a 400-
hour maximum accrual cap.  Employee accrues 6 hours of vacation per pay 
period and used 7 hours of vacation this pay period

395 hours balance plus 6 hours vacation accrued per pay period = 401 hours 
(Unit will maintain a special record of the 1 hour vacation that did not 
accrue because employee is over the 400 hour maximum accrual cap)
400 hours remaining balance minus 7 hours vacation used this pay period = 
393 
total accrual balance

*****
Employees should work with their units to arrange vacation time usage so 
that the vacation balances on their earnings statements for the third pay 
period (January 18, 2004 ? January 31, 2004) are sufficiently below their 
accrual maximums to ensure that future benefits will accrue.  Employees 
should then arrange to use any specially recorded vacation hours as soon 
as possible.

You can view your earnings statement in NESSIE at 
https://nessie.uihr.uillinois.edu/cf/info/index.cfm. More information 
regarding vacation leave for Civil Service employees is also available in 
NESSIE at https://nessie.uihr.uillinois.edu/cf/leave/index.cfm?
Item_id=1403. Refer to Policy and Rules, Rule 7.01, for information on 
accrual rates at

Questions concerning your vacation balance should be directed to your 
supervisor.

To: University of Illinois Employees 
From: Kathe M. Shinham, Assistant Vice President for Business and Finance
Subject: Your Pay in the New UI-Integrate Human Resources/Payroll System
 
The University is implementing the UI-Integrate Human Resources/Payroll 
system beginning with the January 2004 pay dates.  The new system allows 
employees to view Web-based earnings statements three working days before 
payday. Employees paid bi-weekly may view their earnings statement online 
beginning January 9 and employees paid monthly may view their earnings 
statement online beginning January 12.  The Web-based earnings statements 
are available for all employees, including those who elected to receive 
paper earnings statements on payday, in NESSIE at:


To access your online earnings information, you will need your 
Bluestem/Campus Network ID. If you have not already set up your ID, 
information on how to do so is available from the CITES Web page at: 


You may notice a difference in the amount of your net pay.  Net pay 
differences may be related to a change in either salary (i.e., gross pay), 
tax withholdings, or other deductions.  You can determine the cause of a 
difference by comparing your current and former earnings statements.

Net pay differences related to a change in gross pay can occur because of 
a change in salary or the hours reported by hourly paid employees.  
Irreconcilable salary differences should be reported to your HR/Payroll 
representative.  

Net pay differences related to changes in tax withholdings or other 
deductions are typical for the first pay date of a new calendar year and 
may include new charitable deductions, changes in benefits enrollment or 
coverage, or variations in life insurance premiums due to change in age or 
salary.  The UI-Integrate methodology for calculating withholdings and 
other deductions (i.e., parking deductions, union dues, involuntary 
deductions such as garnishments and payment of state debts, or life 
insurance calculations) may cause minor changes in your net pay.  Please 
refer to the information published on the OBFS Web site for more details 
about these differences and additional information to assist you with the 
new online statements and calculations, including an earnings statement 
sample: 

If you have any questions about changes in tax withholdings or other 
deductions, please contact your HR/Payroll representative. Your HR/Payroll 
representative will work with your College/ Administrative unit office, 
campus Human Resources office, and the Payroll Service Office to clarify 
the amounts on your statement or make any necessary adjustments.

Dear Colleagues:

As the semester and the calendar year draw to a close, I want to bring 
you holiday greetings from Joan and me and briefly update you on the 
state of the University of Illinois. I also want to share with you some 
of my activities on behalf of the university.

This is the third consecutive year that we have struggled financially, 
and I know it is wearing. Please know how grateful I am for your 
perseverance and creativity in keeping this wonderful university the gold 
standard for public higher education in Illinois and well beyond.

Obviously, we face the continued reality of reduced state funds, but 
higher enrollments. Fewer faculty and professional and support staff, but 
more work. Less time and energy, but greater demands for our good ideas 
and expertise. As if all that were not enough, we have undertaken a much-
needed technology upgrade that touches every one of us.

In good years--and especially, in bad--we each do our part to make this 
university run at the highest level. Your hard work as a teacher, 
scholar, researcher, secretary, librarian, nurse, curator, plumber, 
computer administrator--whatever you do--makes this university succeed, 
day in and day out.

And succeed you have! From faculty honored by the Royal Swedish Academy 
of Sciences to students named as Fulbright and Gates scholars, the 
excellence of this university is recognized far and wide.

Our chancellors, provosts, deans, directors, and department heads have 
spent the last three years wrestling with budget constraints and being 
forced to make tough decisions that balance necessity against desire. 
They all deserve a special nod of thanks for their extraordinary 
commitment to their campuses and our university.

And as they went about their difficult work, so did I.

Most of the president's business is external--on behalf of the University 
of Illinois I face outward to the Congress, the Illinois General 
Assembly, the corporate world, donors, alumni, and, yes, the media. The 
internal work most typically is expressed through periodic open dialogue 
with the University Senates Conference, campus Senate meetings, academic 
professional organizations, and the like. This year, I even taught a 
journalism course session on myths about the university's affordability, 
administrative overhead, and research productivity.

My calendar, however, by design and imperative is primarily 
outward-looking. Since September, I have met with nearly 40 legislators 
on campus or in their districts; 15 of those interactions were 
specifically about our proposed (and subsequently approved) tuition 
program for 2004-05. Included, of course, are the House and Senate 
leaders and members of the Legislative Audit Commission.

In this same period, I made three community visits to various regions of 
the state, a practice of mine for the last eight years. Typically these 
visits include lunch speeches and alumni receptions, media interviews, 
and editorial-board meetings. I was especially excited by a speech 
opportunity with Rotary One in Chicago and the opportunity to deliver 
remarks at Trustee Frances Carroll's church. The underlying theme of my 
public statements, regardless of the setting, is the value of public 
higher education to this nation. The text of my Rotary One ""stump speech"" 
is at 
www.uillinois.edu/president/
speeches/.


It is the same message I bring to all my public interactions, including 
in the last three months, meetings of the Illinois Board of Higher 
Education, the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago, the 
annual Salute to Academic Achievement for high-achieving minority high 
school students, state agricultural leaders, the Illinois Latino Caucus, 
and the Illinois Coalition. Finally, in November I ended a term as 
chairman of the Board of Directors of the National Association of State 
Universities and Land-Grant Colleges. Three of the last four University 
of Illinois presidents have chaired this important organization, and I am 
honored to have served NASULGC and American public higher education this 
way.

I hope this outline of my activities reminds you that we all serve the 
University of Illinois in the ways our positions dictate. The president 
of the university primarily engages our external audiences and 
constituents in support of the university's missions and goals. But the 
hard work of the institution is in your hands.

We are halfway through the academic year. We are challenged to be 
optimistic as we serve our students, our patients, our many publics who 
rely on us.

Again, thank you for your good work. Have a peaceful and joyful holiday 
season and a healthy and happy new year.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Review of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs","Dear Colleagues,

As you know, it has become standard practice on this campus for the Vice 
Chancellors to be reviewed annually in a general way, and for one of them 
to be reviewed in depth each year.  This year it is the turn of Patricia 
Askew for an in-depth review.  She is to be reviewed in her role as Vice 
Chancellor for Student Affairs.

These reviews are of course ultimately the responsibility of the 
Chancellor.  The Chancellor is assisted and advised in undertaking them by 
the Senate Executive Committee.  The full Committee participates in both 
the annual and the quadrennial in-depth reviews.  Annual reviews tend to 
focus mainly upon annual reports submitted by the various Vice 
Chancellors.  In the case of in-depth reviews, a committee of Senate 
Executive Committee members conducts the main work involved. The full 
Committee is then engaged, leading to a discussion with the Chancellor in 
the spring semester.  

I will be chairing the Patricia Askew review committee.  The other members 
of the committee are Jared Bronski, Barclay Jones, and Christopher Mullen 
(the undergraduate student member of the Senate Executive Committee).  I 
am writing to invite you to give us the benefit of your thoughts on the 
performance of Patricia Askew in her capacity as Vice Chancellor for 
Student Affairs.

We welcome your comments in any form you find convenient.  You may convey

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Important Payroll Information","To: U of I Employees 
From: Office of Business and Financial Services
Date: November 25, 2003
Subject: Important Payroll Information
 

Direct Deposit vs. Payroll Check

Effective August 1, 2003 new employees receive their pay via direct 
deposit to their bank account.  Employees hired prior to this date are 
strongly encouraged but not required to enroll in the payroll direct 
deposit program.

Employees that presently receive a payroll check but wish to sign up for 
direct deposit, should go to the NESSIE website:  
.  Select the Compensation 
tab and follow the instructions outlined.  The last day to sign up for 
direct deposit before the Banner conversion is December 19, 2003.  During 
the period of December 20 until December 29, 2003 the system will be 
unavailable due to conversion to the Banner system.  Employees wanting to 
sign up for direct deposit or make changes may do so again beginning 
December 29th.

Payroll Check Distribution

Effective January 1, 2004 payroll checks will be distributed on all 
campuses via mailing services.  
Campus mailing services will pick up payroll checks from the Payroll 
Office on the morning of the day before payday and will deliver them to 
the units based on Mail Code on payday.

Earnings Statement Distribution

Effective January 1, 2004, web-based earnings statements will become the 
official notification to employees regarding their payroll earnings.  
Employees will be able to view not only current period earnings 
information, but fifteen months of historical earnings information as 
well.  Further, the electronic format will contain additional detail that 
is not on the paper statement or check stub.  The web-based earnings 
statement will be available via NESSIE at: 
.

Employees may elect to continue to receive paper earnings statements in 
addition to the official web-based earnings statements.  To do so, an 
employee must submit a Request for Paper Earnings Statement form to the 
campus Payroll Office.  Please note that requests received after December 
5, 2003 may not be processed in time for employees to receive paper 
earnings statements for the first pay date in January 2004.

Credit Union Deposits

The method of depositing funds from employee paychecks into UI Credit 
Unions will change after the University implements the new UI-
Integrate/Banner HR/Payroll system in December 2003.

Currently, Credit Union deposits are processed as Payroll Deductions.  As 
of the first pay period in January 2004, employee deductions to Credit 
Unions will be converted to a Direct Deposit transaction. The conversion 
to Direct Deposit will happen automatically and there is no action that 
employees need to take.

As part of the conversion effort, no changes to Credit Union deduction 
information can be made from December 1 through December 29.  Any changes 
to Credit Union deduction information, or new requests to set up Credit 
Union deposits, will need to be made via NESSIE on or after December 29, 
2003 and will be reflected in the first pay following the change.

After receiving the first paycheck in January, employees should check 
their earnings statement to make sure that the Credit Union Direct Deposit 
is reflected.  

If you have questions about these upcoming payroll changes or need 
assistance with a Request for Paper Earnings Statement or to sign up for 
Direct Deposit, please contact your campus Payroll Office.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - ANNUAL MESSAGE ON RESEARCH INTEGRITY POLICIES","ANNUAL MESSAGE ON RESEARCH INTEGRITY POLICIES

TO:  Faculty, staff, and students who conduct research

FROM:  Charles F. Zukoski, Vice Chancellor for Research 

For compliance purposes, federal and state sponsors of research require 
that all faculty, staff, and students engaged in sponsored research be 
informed regularly about campus policies on research integrity.

The University-wide procedures for addressing particular instances of 
unethical conduct in research and publication are stated in the POLICY AND 
PROCEDURES ON ACADEMIC INTEGRITY IN RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION.  This 
document is available on the Web at 
http://www.research.uiuc.edu/ai/index.asp

Under this policy, all members of the University community are expected to 
observe high standards of academic integrity and ethical behavior in 
research and publication.  Any practice or conduct by a member of the 
University community that seriously deviates from those ethical standards 
for proposing, conducting, and publishing research that are commonly 
accepted within the professional community constitutes academic misconduct 
in violation of University policy. 

Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to:

   a. Fabrication or falsification of data, including intentionally 
misleading, selective, or deliberately false reporting of credentials or 
other academically related information; 
   b. Unacknowledged appropriation of the work of others, including 
plagiarism, the abuse of confidentiality with respect to unpublished 
materials, or misappropriation of physical materials; 
   c. Evasion of or intentional failure after notice by the University or 
federal, state, or another appropriate agency to comply with research 
regulations or requirements, including but not limited to those applying 
to human subjects, laboratory animals, new drugs, radioactive materials, 
genetically altered organisms, and to safety; and 
   d. Other conduct which seriously deviates from accepted ethical 
standards in scholarship.

Differences of interpretation or judgment or honest error do not 
constitute academic misconduct. 

A student or faculty member who believes that academic misconduct has 
occurred has several options for pursuing the matter informally.  Most 
such problems can and should be resolved without resort to formal 
procedures, through consultation with an adviser, department or unit head, 
or the campus Research Standards Officer, Howard Guenther, Associate Vice 
Chancellor for Research.

The official campus statement on ""Responsible Professional Conduct: 
Guidelines for Teaching, Research, and Service"" is printed in the ACADEMIC 
STAFF HANDBOOK (2002-2004), pp. 63-67, and available on the Web at 
http://www.ahr.uiuc.edu/ahrhandbook/chap5/Default.htm

charges, such as tuition and room and board, are due this semester. The 
new schedule, shown below, reflects our delay in managing the bills for 
the first part of the semester.   For the next three months, statements

FROM:	Harry H. Hilton, Chair, Senate Committee on Honorary Degrees
RE:	Nominations for Honorary Degrees for May 2005 Commencements

The Senate Committee on Honorary Degrees is pleased to invite nominations 
for the May 2005 honorary degree awards.  Nomination procedures are 
detailed below.   You are urged to nominate, through your unit 
(department, school, college, etc.), outstanding candidates for Honorary 
Degree awards.  

The committee requests that nominations and supporting materials for the 
May 2005 commencement be submitted by November 15, 2003.  All previously 
submitted candidates not recommended to the Senate at this time will be 
consid-ered by the Committee as 2005 candidates.  The Committee urges all 
units contemplating submitting a nomination to begin their preparation as 
soon as possible.  Please note that in order to maintain absolute 
confidentiality and avoid possible embarrassment to the candidate and to 
the University in case of lack of approval, under no circumstances is any 
potential candidate to be contacted even to obtain lists of references 
and/or vitae.  You may contact hers/his sec-retary, colleague, etc., swear 
the person to absolute secrecy and obtain such a list. Please use only non 
UoI persons for references.  Only the President and/or Chancellor may 
contact candidates.

The Committee appreciates your help in identifying outstanding individuals 
whom the University can honor and, in so doing, honor itself.  If you have 
any questions or need additional information, please contact the Senate 
Office (333-6805).  For your convenience, a nomination form is at: 
http://www.uiuc.edu/providers/senate/hd_form.html


REQUEST FOR NOMINATIONS FOR HONORARY DEGREES

The prime, controlling consideration should be distinction.  The person 
should have made a distinguished contribution to knowledge and creativity 
in the relevant field of endeavor, and have shown sustained activity of 
uncommon merit.  The contributions may be made in a wide range of 
activities; the following list is not exhaustive:

- Scholarship, in any discipline:  major breakthroughs in knowledge in 
fields of scholarly work.
- Creative Arts, in the broad sense of the term:  literature, music, 
architecture, engineering, et al; the development of new frontiers of 
creativity.
- Professions:  distinguished contributions, innovative work of 
distinction.
- Public Service:  outstanding achievement in statesmanship, 
administration, legislative activity, the judiciary.
- Business and Industry:  outstanding, innovative activity in the business 
community.

Following Senate guidelines, the Committee will consider, but not be bound 
by, the degree to which the candidate has had some association with 
Illinois - the University or the State.  While alumni of the University 
should not be excluded, honorary degrees are not a means of recognizing 
their contributions; other awards exist for this purpose.  Current ad-
ministrators, faculty, or staff of the University ordinarily are not 
eligible; while emeriti are eligible even if engaged in teaching or 
research at the University.  Elected officials of the State of Illinois 
and its subordinate units and members of the Legislature, during their 
terms of office, ordinarily are not eligible.

Senate guidelines emphasize recommendations by departments and other 
academic units.  A nomination coming to the Committee from a member of the 
Board of Trustees, an alumnus/alumna or friend of the University, will be 
re-ferred to the proper academic unit for support of the faculty.

For full consideration by the Committee, the nominator or nominating unit 
should supply the following information to the Committee by November 15, 
2003:

1.     A brief letter of nomination, summarizing the candidate's 
qualifications for this honor, and certifying the support of the 
appropriate academic unit.

2.     A brief curriculum vitae of the nominee, including addresses, 
telephone numbers, or other means by which the nominee can be reached.  If 
the nomination finds substantial initial support in the Honorary Degrees 
Committee, addi-tional information may be requested from the department to 
develop the case and to provide the Senate with the mate-rials it needs 
for the final decision.

3.     The names and addresses of at least four professionally-
distinguished individuals who could be contacted for let-ters of support 
or further information about the candidate.  It is hoped that oral 
communications among professional colleagues will help assure the 
confidentiality of the decision process.

Nominations and full dossiers should be marked confidential and sent to 
the Committee on Honorary Degrees, c/o Senate Office, 228 English

Dear Colleague,

The Bylaws of the Senate, Part A 6., states: The Senate shall call an 
annual meeting of the faculty of the campus to hear reports from and to 
question the Senate Executive Committee and the administration.

This year's Annual Meeting of the Faculty will take place on Monday, 
September 22, at 3:10 PM in Illini Room C of the Illini Union. 

President James Stukel and Chancellor Nancy Cantor will deliver remarks, 
after which there will be an open discussion session during which your 
questions and comments will be welcome. They regard this meeting as an 
important occasion, and intend to use it to good effect. They will give 
you their sense of where we stand, what we are up against, and what is to 
be done; and they will be interested in hearing from you, both on the 
matters they mention and on others. 

The Annual Meeting of the Faculty can and should serve as a forum for a 
discussion of issues affecting all of us, to which both administrators and

September 5, 2003

Dear Colleagues:

Welcome to what surely will be one of the most challenging years the 
University of Illinois has faced in modern times.  We have more students 
than ever, and fewer faculty and graduate students to teach them. We have 
a bigger budget than ever, but significantly less money from our single 
most important source, the State of Illinois. We have greater demands on 
us for evidence of accountability and fewer of us to do the work. These 
countervailing forces, which can be summed up as ""Do more with less,"" are 
difficult, but I ask all of you to lean into the wind.

Whether you are a longtime faculty or staff member or new to our campuses 
in Chicago, Springfield, and Urbana-Champaign, I hope one thing is clear: 
this university will move forward, clearing hurdles as we go, because we 
know no other way. It is in our charter that we will teach, that we will 
discover, and that we will serve.

The nation's public universities, which educate fully 80 percent of all 
students in college, fueled the successes of the American Century, and 
the University of Illinois has grown in size, stature, and impact as the 
nation has. The land-grant universities, a special subset of public 
higher education, brought this country's agriculture and engineering to 
new heights, and the University of Illinois was in the vanguard. The 
nation's research universities, another subset of American higher 
education, encouraged discovery and innovation that led to longer lives, 
more conveniences, and, yes, the means to surf the world's knowledge on 
our home computers. The University of Illinois was in the top tier of 
research universities--and remains there. Public universities made and 
kept a promise to be affordable, to be comprehensive, and to be open to 
changing demographics and shifts in populations. The University of 
Illinois works every day to reflect today's world, even as our libraries 
and galleries honor the knowledge and peoples of the past.

All of this work--all of the effort in our multifaceted identity as a 
great public, land-grant, research university of opportunity--relies on 
your contributions. Only your commitment and hard work can help the 
university fulfill its obligations. Those of us who are honored to lead 
the University of Illinois--our Board of Trustees, the chancellors, the 
provosts and the deans, especially--understand the difficult choices 
being made every day up and down this large organization. Their thousands 
of decisions--small and big--are both a burden and an opportunity to take 
a closer look at what we are doing and whether, because of our financial 
woes, we can do some things better or smarter, or not at all. We have 
tried these last two years to protect our academic offerings; 
unfortunately, our students will bear some negative consequences. But, as 
all university presidents must, I remain an optimist and ask you to stay 
with us with the expectation of a better tomorrow.

As always, Joan and I wish each of you a most productive and fulfilling 
year.

The 22 Illini provides safe secure transportation throughout the main 
campus area. The Illini operates every 10 minutes until 3:00AM seven days 
a week and until 5:00AM on Friday & Saturday nights. 

The 50 Green Late Night and 100 Yellow Late Night Routes also provide safe 
secure transportation through the main campus area and between Downtown 
Urbana and Champaign. The routes are connected to one another in Downtown 
Champaign so passengers can continue from one route to another without 
getting off the bus. Both routes operate every 30 minutes until 3:00AM 
seven days a week and until 5:00AM on Friday & Saturday nights.

SafeRides acts as a safety-net for individuals in areas around campus. 
SafeRides is not available for any trip which can be completed on the 22 
Illini Route. Once the 22 Illini stops operating then SafeRides serves all 
of campus. Service operates seven days a week from Dusk (7:00PM - 5:00PM 
after the time change) until 6:30AM and is available by calling 265-Ride.

The purpose of SafeRides is to provide safe transportation to students who 
generally are traveling alone when no other means of safe transportation 
are available. 

There is a maximum limit of three (3) persons per pick-up location within 
the SafeRides boundaries.

SafeRides is not meant to take groups out, but primarily individuals. 
Groups should ride the 22 Illini route or the closest available community 
route operating.

For those individuals who are concerned about walking to or waiting at the 
bus stop for the 22 Illini, SafeWalks Escort Service is available by 
contacting University Police at 333-1216 or via an emergency campus phone.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Residence Hall Network","To:  All faculty, staff and students

Campus Information Technologies and Educational Services (CITES) recently
sent an email to all Urbana students to make them aware of the potential
impact of the so-called ""Blaster"" worm and ""sobig"" virus, which had already
infected seven hundred campus systems earlier this week, as well as
machines at businesses, homes, and campuses around the world. Because of
the aggressiveness of these attacks, the Residence Halls in concert with
CITES  have taken the unusual step of asking that all  Residence Hall
students validate their systems for virus protection and patches before
their computer networks are turned on.  This will mean that students will
need extra time to connect their computers to the Residence Hall network;
in the mean time, all students will be able to use the computer labs (as
always) to access online services.

This step was essential because the alternative --  hundreds or thousands
of unpatched systems becoming compromised at the same time -- would
virtually ensure an unusable network and even greater disruption for those
additional students whose machines would become compromised through the
""infection"" process.

We ask that the entire community understand the uniqueness and truly global
nature of these computer problems.  In this regard, Illinois is not unique,
but we believe it is unique in the responsiveness and dedication of the
staff in finding the best possible solution.  We apologize to the student
community and to the faculty for the disruption as students return to
campus and ask the faculty for patience as students get their systems
online.   The CITES web pages at www.cites.uiuc.edu will have up-to-date
advisories.  If you have questions contact cio@uiuc.edu.

pianos and doing repairs. He and a fellow technician also rebuild 
pianos between other projects. 

RESEARCH NEWS:
*  Tai Chi may benefit older people:  As they age, people tend to 
become more prone to slipping, tripping and falling. And the results 
of such missteps and tumbles sometimes can be catastrophic. 
That's why movement researchers are increasingly focusing on the 
physiological effects and potential health benefits associated with Tai 
Chi, an ancient Chinese martial art that combines aspects of 
movement and meditation.

*  Math education: Research says earliest steps can play a role in 
how well preschoolers learn math. How a child comes to understand 
""two-ness"" and ""three-ness"" and other basic but abstract concepts 
lays the foundation for what comes later, says researcher Art 
Baroody.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Immediate action: Microsoft vulnerability","
As you may have read in the newspaper or heard from colleagues on campus, 
the national educational and business communities are responding to an 
unprecedented network attack affecting Microsoft systems-- desktops, 
laptops, and servers. CITES has been working with the campus computer 
security contacts in each unit to make sure the ""patches"" (system repairs) 
are applied to the tens of thousands of systems on campus running Microsoft 
operating systems.  Even at that,  the so-called Blaster worm associated 
with this attack has affected over seven hundred systems on the Urbana 
campus.   There are still several thousand computers on campus running the 
Microsoft operating system that remain unprotected.

If  your computer runs the Microsoft operating system and you are 
responsible for maintaining it,  we are asking you to remove your computer 
from the network or apply patches IMMEDIATELY.  Not only should you worry 
about your desktop system at work, but also any laptop computer or 
computers at home that use the campus VPN services to connect to the 
network.   Patches are available at no charge at 
http://www.cites.uiuc.edu/sus   If you need personal assistance, you may 
contract with our Departmental Services OnSite Support service 
(onsite@uiuc.edu or 333-8628 during normal business hours).

Because of the impact to our infrastructure caused by this attack, we may 
need to block subnets, even at the departmental level, to prevent this 
fast-spreading worm from doing more damage.   We have received advisories 
from the federal Department of Homeland Security and other security-related 
groups regarding the potential damage from this attack and appropriate 
actions.  We apologize in advance for the substantial inconvenience and 
disruption these steps may cause, but again emphasize that this is a 
problem affecting thousands of universities and corporations across the 
nation and we are trying to minimize and contain damage on our campus.

Other universities have estimated their costs for addressing this problem 
in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. We are taking every step we can to 
minimize expenditure in terms of time, money and lost data.

Dear Colleagues:

With the recent conclusion of this year's spring session of the Illinois 
General Assembly, we now have a much clearer picture of the challenges we 
face as we prepare the budget for fiscal year 2004.

The new executive and legislative leadership teams in the state capital 
were confronted with the most severe financial problems this state has 
experienced in several decades. Accordingly, the University of Illinois 
pledged to do all we could to shoulder responsibility for our share of 
this problem. It is, therefore, not surprising that the budget outcomes 
for the U of I included significant reductions in general fund 
appropriations in both FY 2003 and FY 2004.

Shortly after assuming office and with revenues declining and 
expenditures growing, Governor Rod Blagojevich asked public universities 
to return as much of their FY 2003 appropriations as possible without 
disrupting academic programs. The University of Illinois responded by 
returning $29 million in state appropriations in the fourth quarter of 
this year. This rescission followed a general fund reduction in FY 2003 
of $48.7 million from FY 2002. The actual loss of state appropriations 
going from FY 2002 to final FY 2003 appropriations totaled $77.7 million, 
or a reduction of nearly 10 percent. In addition, the university was 
required to absorb another $24.9 million payment in FY 2003 for health 
insurance costs, as it did in FY 2002.

The stage thus was set for the just-concluded legislative session, in 
which the governor and lawmakers set out to erase a projected $5 billion 
state budget deficit.

The operating budget appropriations for the state's public universities 
for FY 2004, which begins July 1, are largely those included in the 
governor's recommended budget. For the University of Illinois, the 
governor recommended, and the General Assembly passed, a general fund 
appropriation of $696.9 million--a $58 million reduction from the FY 2003 
original appropriation and $106.7 million less than the FY 2002 
appropriation.

The General Assembly passed capital appropriations at the governor's 
recommended levels for Repair & Renovation, providing a total of $10.7 
million for the three University of Illinois campuses. Notably, the 
General Assembly added $2 million that was not included in the governor's 
recommended budget for planning for the Lincoln Hall remodeling project 
at UIUC. Other good news includes the fact that reappropriations for 
continuing projects such as the College of Medicine research building at 
UIC, the Siebel engineering facility, the National Center for 
Supercomputing Applications, the Post Genomic Institute, the incubator 
building, Chemical Sciences at UIUC, the UIS classroom-office building, 
and the state survey projects were also included in the capital budget, 
allowing work already under way to continue to move to completion.

In summary, the extraordinarily severe financial problems facing the 
state resulted in operating and capital appropriations for the University 
of Illinois that were substantially lower than what we had hoped for as 
we prepared our budget request last summer. Nevertheless, the governor 
and legislature's tax-dollar support will enable the University of 
Illinois to continue to pursue our missions of education, research, 
service, and economic development. Further, we will strive to maintain 
the quality that has been the hallmark of the University of Illinois 
despite the diminution of state support.

High quality distinguishes our three campuses and makes the U of I one of 
the best universities in the nation. The challenge always is to keep our 
edge in the face of diminished resources, and we accomplish this through 
a dedicated faculty and staff and efficient management. I am confident 
our university has the leadership and spirit to persevere in these 
difficult times.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Salary Issues","May 9, 2003

Members of the University Community

An article appeared in Thursday's Daily Illini regarding budget cuts and 
their impact on salaries at the Urbana campus.  The article contained 
quotes from University public affairs officers, who were quoted, perhaps 
out of context, as offering specific predictions about decisions that will 
be made at the campus level.  Unfortunately, the article makes it seem 
likely that salaries for next year will either be frozen or raises, if 
any, would be given across the board.

The predictions offered in the article do not reflect the position of 
Urbana campus administrators, and I write to make it clear that we have 
every intention of seeking the resources to address salary issues.  The 
Chancellor and I have stated this intention many times, in conversations 
with deans, department heads, faculty and staff across the campus.  We 
have also been quite clear about preserving the long-standing commitment 
of our campus to merit-based salary increases and not engaging in across 
the board or ""uniform raises.""   It is premature, at best, to comment on 
particulars, and I ask for your patience as we wait for actual budget 
numbers upon which we will base these important decisions.

A number of faculty and staff have expressed to me their alarm over 
Thursday's article.  I hope I have clarified our campus position and laid 
to rest any anxieties created by the article.  The Chancellor and I are 
keenly aware of the importance of salary issues, and we will do all that 
we can to address them.  Thank you for your continued commitment to this 
great institution.

Very truly yours,

Richard Herman

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Peer to Peer Filesharing-Copyright Responsibility","May 2, 2003

To: The Student Community at the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign:

As discussed in a recent Daily Illini article (April 17, p. 1), the 
Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has recently sued four 
students at other universities for possessing and distributing copyrighted 
music without the consent of the copyright owners. The recording and movie 
industries have also requested that universities reassess their policies 
and practices, and increase their educational efforts about copyright 
infringement. More than that, it is just plain unfair to artists to take 
and enjoy their work without their receiving appropriate compensation. We 
are concerned and want you to understand why this is important to you as 
students on the Champaign-Urbana campus.

The likelihood of individual students being pursued for misuse of 
copyrighted materials has increased dramatically over this past year. If 
someone owns a currently valid copyright in a work-- a song, video, image, 
article or computer program, for example-- and you obtain it, use it, or 
share it without paying for it, without seeking appropriate permission 
from the copyright owner, or without obtaining authorization under the 
copyright law such as via  ""fair use"", you may be violating copyright law. 
As an example, you might use peer-to-peer software programs in order to 
obtain a free copy of a favorite song or to share it with others, where 
the copyright is owned by another. If you do not have permission from the 
owner or authorization under the law, you could be sued by the copyright 
holder of that song, have criminal charges brought against you, and/or be 
subject to discipline by the University. Each of these alternatives has 
happened to students at other universities. At Illinois, students have had 
their network privileges revoked, along with other disciplinary action, 
when the network was misused over copyright issues.

No one on our campus should be serving out copyrighted songs or movies in 
this way. If you are using peer-to-peer file sharing programs, check that 
you are not inadvertently serving out unauthorized copyrighted data; many 
peer-to-peer software packages automatically configure your computer to 
share files, but you are responsible nonetheless. If you currently have 
unauthorized copyrighted information on your computer, you should remove 
it.

The University takes very seriously its responsibilities as steward of the 
campus network. We encourage you to take full advantage of our wonderful 
electronic resources to advance your education, including fostering and 
creating new friendships, and communicating and sharing ideas with your 
peers here and around the world. We want to ensure that, as you do so, you 
take seriously your responsibility to respect copyrighted material.

Sincerely,

Pete Siegel

Dear Colleagues:

As we wind up another successful and eventful academic year, I want to 
express my gratitude to every one of you for the hard work that makes 
this a great university and to wish you a pleasant and productive summer.

This year marks the fortieth anniversary of my earning a master's degree 
at the University of Illinois, and I have been proud to be a part of the 
university community ever since. Every day, every semester, and every 
year, I continue to be inspired by the wonderful things, great and small, 
taking place on our three campuses.

This year was no exception. The accolades and awards continued to roll in 
for our outstanding faculty and students. The staff that keeps the 
university running--and makes possible the discovery and transfer of 
knowledge--did so with record enrollment that challenged our capacity for 
delivering high-quality education, research, and public service. It's all 
heady, exciting stuff, and it is what makes our university environment so 
exhilarating.

It is a tribute to each one of you that the University of Illinois 
maintains its preeminence in American higher education despite our 
state's troubled financial condition. This was another extremely 
difficult year for our budget, and we can expect more of the same in the 
coming year. (Stay abreast of developments by visiting my Web site: 
www.uillinois.edu/president/.)

To provide some context for what is in store: if the governor's proposed 
budget for fiscal year 2004 is approved by the legislature, the U. of I. 
will have absorbed nearly $200 million in lost state revenue since fiscal 
year 2002. The impact such a staggering loss of state support has on 
salaries, academic programs, tuition and fees, student and employee 
services, and the upkeep of facilities at a public university cannot be 
underestimated.

The chancellors and provosts, my office, and our Board of Trustees will 
collaborate and work with the legislature for the remainder of the spring 
to manage this latest round of budget cuts in order to preserve the 
exceptional quality of the university. It is too early to say what the 
impact will be on the price to our students. The fact is that we will 
have fewer employees, starting in the administrative offices, and fewer 
academic offerings and services when the new academic year begins.

In my four decades at the University of Illinois, our great people have 
always proven their resiliency and excelled in good times as well as bad. 
It is impossible to describe how meaningful your continued dedication to 
excellence is to the university and, equally important, to the people of 
Illinois. I have never been prouder of my association with this 
university, and I look forward to working with you to meet the challenges 
we face.

As always, Joan and I wish you a safe and refreshing summer respite.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Full-time Enrollment for Graduate Students","Dear Graduate Students:

The Graduate College Executive Committee has approved a change in the 
policy on what constitutes full-time enrollment for graduate students.  
This policy will be implemented in two phases. The first phase, effective 
Summer 1 2003, affects only international graduate students for whom 
reporting is being done via the SEVIS system. The second phase, which will 
affect all graduate students, will be effective Fall 2004, when the Banner 
system will be introduced for student records and registration. 

Graduate students may be required to maintain full-time enrollment for 
several reasons. Many academic programs require registered students to 
maintain a full-time load. Full-time status may also be required for 
certification related to student loans, fellowship and traineeship 
appointments, and certain types of non-University medical insurance 
policies. International students may be required to maintain full-time 
status for purposes of Student Exchange and Visitor Information System 
(SEVIS) reporting.

FROM:	        Richard H. Herman
		Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs

DATE:		April 11, 2003

SUBJECT:	        Changes in Service and Pay Dates	

Beginning this September, the pay date calendar for the Urbana-Champaign 
and Chicago campuses will be moved to the 16th of each month, which will 
allow the University to have common service and pay dates.  The change 
will not impact paychecks for employees who are paid bi-weekly.  

Information about how academic employees will be affected is provided in 
detail at http://www.provost.uiuc.edu/provost/announce/paydates.html   
Below is summary information for different employee groups:

1.	Continuing faculty who are paid on a 9/12 basis (employees who 
are on a nine-month contract paid out over 12 months), will receive the 
final installment of their annual salary on August 21, and their new 
contract dates will be August 16, 2003 through May 15, 2004.  The paycheck 
that they receive on September 16 will be the full one-twelfth payment for 
the new contract year.

2.	University policy allows up to two months of summer pay.  What 
has been a third month summer appointment for some faculty and research 
assistants, who have been approved by the Chancellor or her designee, will 
be, this one year, shortened by five days, ending August 15 instead of 
August 20, so that there will be no overlap with the contract period for 
faculty, which begins on August 16. 

3.	Appointments for continuing ten-month academic employees 
(employees who are on a ten-month contract paid out over 12 months) will 
vary based on the period of service.  However, the pay date for these 
employees will also be on the 16th of each month.

4.	Continuing 12-month academic employees, including faculty on 12-
month appointments, will receive their final FY 02-03 paycheck on August 
21 and another paycheck on September 16 for work attributed to the shorter 
period of August 21 to September 15.  Since that check will be issued five 
days early, the amount will be prorated to reflect the shorter period.  
The October 16 pay check will reflect the full work month of September 16 
through October 15.  

For budgeting purposes, these 12-month employees should plan for a one-
time impact in cash flow for September.  For those who believe that this 
will create a financial hardship, I want you to know that we are exploring 
a loan program to assist employees with cash flow issues in the transition 
period.   Information about this program will be forthcoming.  

Direct deposit will process automatically the earlier deposit of paychecks 
for all employees with the earlier paydate, if employees are enrolled in 
that service.

Prior to the budget processing date, departments should notify all new 
employees that their annual contracts will run from August 16, 2003 
through August 15, 2004.

As we near the end of the semester, and spring brings on warmer weather, 
the potential for assault, robbery or other forms of aggressive behavior 
is heightened.  I would like to review a few important tips to help ensure 
the personal safety of everyone - students, staff and faculty.
-  Use the MTD scheduled bus service or SafeRides service - call 265 RIDE
(265-7433). SafeRides hours are 9:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m., seven days a week.
-  Walk in an alert and confident manner, actively pay attention to 
your surroundings, never walk alone after dark, use well-lighted paths, 
and advise me of areas of the campus where improved lighting is needed or 
lights are malfunctioning.
-  If you observe any suspicious activity or people, call 9-9-1-1 
from a campus phone or 9-1-1 from a residential or cell phone.  If you do 
not own a cell phone you may request a recycled phone that can be used for 
emergency 911 calls from the Offices of the Dean of Students or the 
International Student Affairs.
-  University police provide walking, bike and mobile patrols of our 
campus community 24 hours every day.  They are well trained and prepared 
to assist you with any type of emergency you may have.
-  Make a note of the locations of the emergency phones around the 
campus  and use them to contact police if your safety is in jeopardy or 
you  need emergency assistance that if you ever become the victim of any 
crime, please contact the police 
-  You can check the Division of public safety?s web site 
(http://www.dps.uiuc.edu) to find if there are any special security/alert 
issues that may be of concern.
-  Do not leave your apartment unlocked even to go next door to visit 
a friend.
-  Remember that the more you drink, the easier target you will be 
for criminals.
-  Share safety tips and contents of this alert with friends.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Donations to International Support Fund","As our nation develops new laws and more tightly enforces existing laws 
that regulate visitors to the United States, our international students, 
faculty, and staff find themselves facing new requirements and the real 
possibility of incurring additional costs during their stay in the U.S.

Many members of our academic community must now go to regional U. S. 
Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services offices to be interviewed 
and fingerprinted and to provide substantial information before they are 
cleared to resume their residency in the U. S.  Others have returned home 
for brief visits, only to find themselves facing substantial waiting 
periods for visa clearance and permission to return to the U. S.  Still 
others await clearances from federal agencies before being able to work in 
certain positions in our university.

We have been actively working with these agencies to make these processes 
go as smoothly as possible. However, unanticipated costs can arise from 
these and other situations such as travel, lodging, and the need to gather 
substantial amounts of information and, in some cases, to access 
professional assistance.

To assist these members of our community in responding to unexpected 
difficulties and expenses, we have established an International Support 
Fund.  This fund will be administered by Earl D. Kellogg, Associate 
Provost for International Affairs.  We will develop criteria to be used by 
a committee of faculty, students, and staff in a rigorous process of 
deciding which requests to grant.   These criteria will focus on urgent 
needs and the relevance of the request to the overall purpose of the Fund.

We have already received a few donations and want to bring this 
opportunity to the attention of all our faculty and staff.  Illinois 
faculty and staff have a tradition of assisting each other, and we hope 
you will decide to join us in sending your tax-deductible donation to the 
University of Illinois Foundation International Support Fund.  

There are two ways you can contribute.  First, by clicking on this web

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Budget Message from the President","March 3l, 2003

To: Members of the University Community

The news coming out of Springfield about the State of Illinois's fiscal 
situation is grim and impacts the entire university community.

In order to close the budget deficit for the current fiscal year and pass 
a balanced budget, as required by law, for fiscal year 2004, the governor 
and state lawmakers are considering a level of spending cuts that further 
reduces the state's appropriation for public universities.

The University of Illinois is committed to doing its part to help address 
the state's budgetary crisis, but it will be a difficult task.

Working through our Board of Trustees, we have taken steps to enhance the 
university's accountability and to identify ways to operate more 
efficiently. Working with leaders on each campus, we have responded 
conscientiously to the call for additional immediate savings with 
proposed cuts we think would do the least harm to the quality of our 
excellent academic programs.

However, our financial flexibility is nearly exhausted after back-to-back 
cuts in our appropriations for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. An additional 
loss of state support at the levels being discussed will imperil the 
quality of our academic offerings.
To stay abreast of this important issue, I invite you to go to 
www.uillinois.edu/president/ to review an account of a testimony I 
recently provided to the state Senate Appropriations Committee, a list of 
the university spending cuts under consideration for the current fiscal 
year, and other related information.

The legislature will deliberate budget priorities for the next two 
months, and I will continue to make our case in Springfield to keep the 
university strong. As the situation develops, the site will be updated.

TO:  Members of the University Community


      The conflict in Iraq has begun and we are all a little uneasy today 
about it and about our own personal security.  Be assured that our 
campuses have in place security measures to respond to the heightened 
national state of alert and any emergencies that might arise.  
      
      As members of the University of Illinois family, our thoughts and 
prayers, whatever our faith, are for a speedy end to the conflict and the 
safety of those in harm?s way.  In the weeks and months ahead, we all - 
students, faculty and staff - have work to do and lives to lead.  Let's 
do our best to go about our business, respectful of one another and 
mindful of those directly engaged in the war.  
      
      And let's take a moment, regardless of our views, to cherish the 
peace and freedom we hold so dear.

Re: University Vacation Usage

On March 5, 2003, Governor Rod Blagojevich issued an administrative order 
calling for new restrictions on State employees regarding unused vacation 
time and vacation time payouts. This order is intended to address reports 
that some employees of the previous administration received single-time 
payouts for unused vacation time at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars 
each. Under this order, Blagojevich will set a ceiling on the number of 
vacation days - 5 per year - that State employees working under his office 
can carry over from year to year. 

This administrative order affects only State agency employees working 
under the Governor's office; it does not affect State university 
employees. Employees at the University of Illinois will continue to follow 
vacation leave policy provisions in Policy and Rules 
(https://nessie.uihr.uillinois.edu/pdf/policy/rules/pr7chap.pdf) for civil

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Review for the Intercampus Research Initiative ","Program Review for the Intercampus Research Initiative in
Biotechnology (IRIB)

As co-chairs of the review panel for the IRIB program, we are writing to
request your opinion on the effectiveness of this program at meeting its
primary objective to stimulate intercampus collaboration, leading to
additional extramural funding.  In this time of very tight budgets, a
program that provides seed money for innovative interdisciplinary research
is extremely valuable.  However, continued support for this program is
dependent upon the success of its funded initiatives and the consensus of
the faculty that IRIB provides new opportunities to stimulate research in
biotechnology across the campuses.

At the risk of being repetitive, we would like to highlight the goal of
this program, which was to foster intercampus collaborations that result in
extramurally funded collaborative projects.  Ultimately, we hope to develop
a culture where such intercampus collaboration becomes routine.  Thus, the
fundamental question is whether or not this program has significant value
as related to its stated goal and if so, should it be continued in its
present form or modified.

For example:
        1.  Should continuation be at the current, a reduced, or
an expanded level of funding?
        2.  Should the topical or technological area be
redirected/broadened in future competitions?
        3.  Should the number and size of the grants be modified (e.g.
larger number of smaller grants  or a single large center grant)?
        4.  Should the program encourage large group proposals requesting
resources for planning and infrastructure to organize a major
inter-campus center?

Thank you for your consideration of these issues.  We appreciate your
responses and will bring all input to the attention of the full review 
panel.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Creating shared business and support centers","Dear Colleagues,

As you know there are many discussions going on in the State about budget 
cuts to higher education. We must squarely confront the challenge of how 
to absorb any cuts in a way that respects the principles the Provost and I 
stressed in taking last year's cuts and recently outlined in our message 
to you of February 26, 2003.  The people of Illinois have built Urbana-
Champaign over many generations to be an institution of the first class, 
and we will keep it so.  In letters to the deans and vice chancellors last 
fall, the Provost and I asked that planning begin for how to absorb 
reductions in ways that continue our core missions.  Our strategy is being 
formed out of those discussions.

Every economy we can create in the performance of administrative functions 
means fewer cuts will have to be made to the core activities that define 
what we are:  a place where superb education prepares students for success 
in the workplace, as citizens, and as members of a diverse society with 
increasingly global dimensions; where students learn from exceptionally 
talented faculty who are creating the knowledge they teach in their 
classrooms, laboratories, and independent studies; a place where the 
matchless expertise of our faculty, staff and students is applied to 
critical societal issues; and, an institution that continually refashions 
itself to meet new needs, embrace new opportunities, and provide 
leadership.

Our approach to reducing administrative expenses will consist of creating 
clusters of units to share resources within, across, and between colleges, 
departments, centers, and campus-level administrative offices and units.  
We will want to explore opportunities to share where overlapping and 
similar missions, histories of close interaction, and geographical 
proximity will permit the consolidation of business and support 
functions.  The scale of these shared business and service centers will be 
small enough to permit functions to be carried out by people who are 
knowledgeable about unit practices, and close enough to faculty, staff and 
students to be responsive to their needs and deliver effective service.  

Just such an approach has been implemented with units in several colleges 
and administrative units, leading to maintenance of effective and 
responsive services with substantial cost savings.  We must now examine 
the possibilities of using this approach more widely to achieve 
efficiencies and resultant cost savings.

I am asking unit heads to begin immediately the task of identifying 
potential clusters of units where shared business and support services can 
reduce administrative costs while maintaining responsiveness to local 
needs.  In doing so, unit heads will discuss possibilities with heads of 
other units within and across lines of colleges, schools, and campus 
administrative units.

I will appoint a coordinating advisory committee to facilitate discussions 
across the boundaries of our colleges and administrative portfolios.  I am 
asking Provost Richard Herman to chair this committee.  Steven Miller, an 
Illinois alumnus, prominent business leader and member of the Board of the 
University of Illinois Foundation, will serve as external advisor with 
knowledge of organizational models in business and the academy.  Members 
of the committee will include leaders of administrative and service units, 
executive officers of colleges and departments, professionals who work in 
business and support services at all levels, supervisors, students, and 
faculty members.  The composition of this committee will be announced as 
soon as it is formed.  I am requesting that the coordinating advisory 
committee provide its advice to me by April 7, 2003, so that the 
committee's contribution can be fully integrated into our plans for the 
FY04 budget.  A major task of this committee will be to assure that shared 
business and support service centers are implemented in ways that are 
equitable to all units and serve the overriding interests of the campus as 
a whole.

Creation of shared business and service centers will not, by itself, 
achieve sufficient savings to absorb the full reductions we will take in 
FY04.  But this step will help to absorb much of those reductions by 
streamlining administrative services, which must be a cornerstone of any 
strategy to preserve the excellence of our university with diminished 
resources.

Cordially,

Nancy Cantor
Chancellor

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Supporting International Students, Faculty & Staff","Dear Members of the Campus Community:

We have one of the largest enrollments of international students in the 
nation, 4,555 students among the 39,300 who registered last fall. These 
students, along with our international faculty and staff, are valued 
members of our community, contributing greatly to life on our campus.  

As you know, new Federal policies to promote national security have begun 
to affect the international members of our community.  I am writing to let 
you know how this is going and what we plan to do.

We have begun operating the internet-based record-keeping system called 
SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System), required by law 
of all colleges and universities.   

Ivor M. Emmanuel, director of the Office of International Student Affairs, 
and Carol Buss, director of the Office of International Faculty and Staff 
Affairs have worked closely with deans, program directors, department 
heads, and academic advisers to keep international students, faculty, and 
staff apprised of the new rules and ongoing requirements.  They and all 
the units that include them will need to be attentive to the demands of a 
newly intensified regulatory environment.

Earlier this year, the Federal government announced its fourth round of 
call-ins for international visitors to the United States. These now affect 
citizens of 25 nations. So far, 205 students and 20 faculty and staff from 
our campus have been called to register at the I.N.S. offices in Chicago. 
Staff members from the Office of International Student Affairs have 
accompanied some of the students. The Office of International Faculty and 
Staff Affairs has worked with the faculty and staff involved.   I am 
pleased by reports that these registrations have gone smoothly, without 
the difficulties so widely-reported elsewhere.

We are also consulting with other universities and scholarly organizations 
in an effort to assure that the new regulations arising from the 
government's legitimate concerns about security are approached in ways 
that are consistent with our academic mission and the individual rights of 
members of our community.  

We are concerned about a number of graduate students, faculty and staff 
who have found it difficult to return to the United States because they 
have been unable to obtain security clearances. Several Chinese students 
have been unable to return from China because of delays in the screening 
of students working in sensitive areas by the Interagency Panel on 
Advanced Science and Security, known as IPASS.  Others have encountered 
long delays in acquiring visas to study in the U.S. 

The Office of International Student Affairs now administers loan programs 
through which students may borrow small amounts for short periods of time 
in the event of an emergency.  There is a comparable Faculty-Staff 
Emergency Fund.  To these, as a demonstration of our concern and support, 
we have added an International Support Fund.   It will be administered by 
Earl D. Kellogg, Associate Provost for International Affairs, who will 
seek contributions from faculty and staff.  He will consult with an 
advisory committee in evaluating requests for legal or other emergency 
aid.     

When the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, accepted the Nobel 
Peace Prize two months ago, he said:  ""We have entered the third 
millennium through a gate of fire.""  In the aftermath of September 11th, 
we face a new kind of insecurity that seems to know no boundaries of 
status or geography. 

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is making every effort to 
insure the safety of members of our community.  We are working hard to 
fulfill our responsibilities to the Federal government in its effort to 
prevent any abuse of international visas.

We must work equally hard to insure that our university is a place of 
openness, empathy, and intense dialogue.  Our success as an institution 
that is focused on learning and research demands an academic environment 
attractive to, and receptive to, excellent students, faculty, and staff 
from all over the world. 

We are preparing future citizens who will find themselves in a world that 
is both increasingly diverse and yet fearfully inclined to polarization 
over that diversity.  Society counts on higher education as a proving 
ground for inter-group relations, for living with and learning from 
difference.  

Our international faculty, staff, and students are part of the solution to 
terrorism - not part of the problem. I hope you will join with me in 
expressing to them your friendship, your concern, and your continuing 
support.  

Nancy Cantor

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Budget Outlook","Dear Colleagues,

As you know there is much discussion nationally about mounting state 
deficits. In Illinois, the State is projecting a deficit of more than 
$4 billion.  We will not know what our State budget will be for next year 
until after the Governor presents his budget address on April 9, but we 
want to share with you what we do know at this point and what steps we are 
taking.  

In March and April, the General Assembly will hold hearings on next year's 
higher education appropriations.  In preparation for those hearings, we 
have been asked to consider how we would absorb cuts of 5% to 10% from 
this year's State appropriation.  Cuts of this magnitude would mean 
reductions to our campus of from $15 million to $30 million, not counting 
other needs.  In a letter to all Illinois public universities, the Chair 
of the House Appropriations Committee said, ""While we hope reductions on 
this scale will not be necessary, we need to be prepared for this 
possibility.""  

Some weeks ago we began the process of planning how to absorb further cuts 
while continuing to provide the services that make our campus uniquely 
valuable to the people of Illinois:  superb education for our students; 
the ability to produce major scientific and scholarly achievements; 
engagement with the economic advancement, cultural life, and societal 
issues of our State and nation.  We have asked each of the Vice 
Chancellors, Deans, and Directors to propose strategies that are 
consistent with this goal.  Their task will involve consultation with unit 
heads and with us as the campus strategy takes form over the next few 
weeks.

As we approach planning for next year, we need to recognize that all 
public universities and other state services are in the same 
circumstance.  We will all be asked to bear our share of the burden.  As 
we benefited from unprecedented levels of State support in 2000-01 and 
2001-02, so must we now deal with reduced State funds in ways that 
continue to support what is special about our university, the things that 
drew us here and lead students to seek admission in record numbers.

Coming on the heels of this year's budget cuts, the task will not be 
easy.  Nor will it be impossible.  Major economies will have to be made, 
and some of them will be painful.  We will identify areas where 
reorganization of activities or responsibilities can free resources to 
invest in our critical missions, our people, and our future.  The steps we 
ultimately take will be formulated in a responsible, principled way, and 
our institution will continue to be a university of which we and the 
people of Illinois will be proud.  

When we wrote to you last winter as we were preparing for this year's 
budget cuts, we indicated that budget reductions would be guided by 
institutional priorities and values.  In the departments, the colleges, 
and at the campus level we made difficult decisions which we believe 
served the institution well.  Thanks to the cooperativeness, dedication, 
and willingness to pitch in by all, this year has seen notable 
achievements.  Our research enterprise is more vital and productive than 
ever.  Annual expenditures on research and development now exceed $350 
million, and indirect cost recoveries generated by research grew during 
the last year by $4.5 million, or 7.3%.  This year we greeted an 
outstanding and diverse group of 180 new faculty colleagues, of whom 40% 
are women and 26% are members of underrepresented minorities.  The quality 
of education we provide to our students has continued, the number and 
qualifications of students who seek admission are higher than ever, and 
new scholarly initiatives have been pursued, several with the help of 
foundation funding.  Our commitment to core assets such as graduate 
fellowships and the library continues unabated.  In short, the principles 
that guided our strategies for absorbing this year's cuts served us well, 
and they will continue to do so. 

The unfolding financial prospects for FY2004 will present tough challenges 
for our stewardship of this great university. We have many aspirations and 
responsibilities.  Foremost among our needs is to find a way to provide a 
salary program for faculty and staff, who after all are the heart of the 
quality of education and intellectual contributions that come from this 
campus.  The process of consultation and planning our approach for next 
year has begun.  Your participation and support in planning with your unit 
heads will be essential to success again this year.  

We will of course keep you informed and involved as the State budget 
develops and our plans begin to take shape.

Re:	Important Notice about Taxability of Certain Assistantship Tuition 
and Service Fee Waivers

This notice is being sent to all graduate and professional students who are 
eligible to hold assistantship appointments accompanied by tuition and 
service fee waivers.  

Current tax law exempts Teaching Assistants (TAs), Research Assistants 
(RAs), and most Fellows from having to pay taxes on tuition and service fee 
waivers associated with these appointments.  
 
While examining the implications of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief 
Reconciliation Act, the University determined that it is necessary to 
document and track the taxability of tuition and service fee waivers 
provided to Graduate Assistants (GAs) and Pre-professional Graduate 
Assistants (PGAs). 

The circumstances under which some or all of a GA's or PGA's tuition and 
service fee waiver may be tax exempt are described below.  

-First, in compliance with Internal Revenue Code Section 127, $5,250 per 
calendar year in tuition and service fee waivers associated with GA and/or 
PGA appointments is excluded from taxable income.  This pertains to all GA 
and PGA appointments. 

-Second, under other Sections of the Internal Revenue Code, GA and PGA 
tuition and service fee waivers exceeding $5,250 per calendar year may be 
excluded from taxable income if the GA or PGA appointment meets certain 
criteria.  

Students receiving waivers associated with GA or PGA appointments will 
receive information from the Payroll Office to assist in determining what 
portion, if any, of the waiver should be considered taxable income and 
whether or not it will be necessary to withhold additional taxes from these 
students' paychecks.  GAs and PGAs may be exempt if:

-The value of the GA or PGA waiver does not exceed $5,250 for the calendar 
year, or
-The value of the waiver exceeds $5,250 for the calendar year and there is 
a concurrent TA or RA appointment that is half or more of the total 
percentage appointment (for example, if you have a combined appointment of 
30% that includes a 15% RA appointment, then you should not receive this 
information), or
-The GA or PGA has a concurrent qualified fellowship appointment as defined 
by IRS Publication 520, Scholarships and Fellowships, which is posted at 
http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p520.pdf.

Information about eligibility and restrictions for graduate-level tuition 
and service fee waivers may be found in Rule 52 of the Code of Policies and 
Regulations Applying to All Students 
(http://www.uiuc.edu/admin_manual/code/) and the Graduate College's ""Policy 
on Selection of Graduate Student Assistants"" 
(http://www.grad.uiuc.edu/Policies/SelectionOfGraduateStudentAssistants.htm

Information about the University's Educational Assistance Plan will be 
included in subsequent editions of A Handbook for Graduate Students and 
Advisers.

This is a final REMINDER: If you have not already completed our survey, you
have one more opportunity to help us out!

I am Dr. Angela Lyons at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
UIUC is one of several college campuses participating in a research project
on student credit usage and financial knowledge.  I am working with
educators from the state of Illinois to develop a new financial literacy
program called $tudent $marts. The purpose of the program is to develop
resources and materials to help college students make informed financial
decisions related to credit usage. We need your help in learning more about
how students are using credit.

If you are 18 years of age, or older, you may participate in the survey and
that participation is strictly voluntary. You may refuse to participate or
discontinue participation at any time.  There is no penalty.  Your decision
to participate will not affect your present or future relations with the
University of Illinois.  However, by deciding to complete the survey, you
will provide us with valuable information about how credit usage may be
affecting college students today.  

Any and all information we receive will be kept strictly confidential and
will only be seen by authorized members of my staff. Data gathered from the
survey will be analyzed as a whole, excluding all references to any
individual students. Only the results of the analysis will be shared with
researchers and organizations who are interested in providing services to
educate students about credit usage and money management.

Undergraduate students are being contacted at eight campuses in the state
of Illinois as well as Purdue University, University of Missouri-Columbia,
and University of Wisconsin-Madison.  

The online survey will take you about 10 minutes to complete and you must
be 18 years or older to participate. When you are finished, you will be
eligible for a random drawing for one of three $150 gift certificates to
Best Buy.  Each student who completes the survey will have the opportunity
to compete in the drawing.  Winners will be notified by e-mail in 3-4
weeks. Good Luck!

RE: Revisions to University Policy 

At their meeting on February 13, 2003, the Board of Trustees amended the 
University Policy on Family and Medical Leave. The policy was amended to 
reflect changes in Central Management Services regulations and to bring 
University policy into compliance with the Federal Family and Medical 
Leave Act. This memo constitutes notice to all employees that the 
University FMLA tracking year will become a rolling forward tracking year 
as of April 15, 2003.  

Correspondingly, the University Office of Human Resources approved 
revisions to Civil Service Policy and Rules as follows: 

* Regulation 10.014, Family and Medical Leave
* Rule 11.07, Family and Medical  Leave
* Regulations 11.071 to 11.074; 11.076 to 11.077, Family and Medical Leave

More information can be obtained by reviewing the policy changes in their 
entirety or contacting your campus Human Resources Office. Policy changes 
can be viewed in the Policy Announcements section of NESSIE at

I am Dr. Angela Lyons at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
UIUC is one of several college campuses participating in a research project
on student credit usage and financial knowledge.  I am working with
educators from the state of Illinois to develop a new financial literacy
program called $tudent $marts. The purpose of the program is to develop
resources and materials to help college students make informed financial
decisions related to credit usage. We need your help in learning more about
how students are using credit.

If you are 18 years of age, or older, you may participate in the survey and
that participation is strictly voluntary. You may refuse to participate or
discontinue participation at any time.  There is no penalty.  Your decision
to participate will not affect your present or future relations with the
University of Illinois.  However, by deciding to complete the survey, you
will provide us with valuable information about how credit usage may be
affecting college students today.  

Any and all information we receive will be kept strictly confidential and
will only be seen by authorized members of my staff. Data gathered from the
survey will be analyzed as a whole, excluding all references to any
individual students. Only the results of the analysis will be shared with
researchers and organizations who are interested in providing services to
educate students about credit usage and money management.

Undergraduate students are being contacted at eight campuses in the state
of Illinois as well as Purdue University, University of Missouri-Columbia,
and University of Wisconsin-Madison.  

The online survey will take you about 10 minutes to complete and you must
be 18 years or older to participate. When you are finished, you will be
eligible for a random drawing for one of three $150 gift certificates to

Dear Colleagues:

As many of you know, Charles Colbert, Vice Chancellor for Administration 
and Human Services, plans to retire at the end of this calendar year.  I 
have not worked with Charles as long as many of you, but like you, I have 
come to appreciate his dedication to this institution and to the people 
who work here.  We all are grateful for his many contributions, and I will 
miss his good counsel.  We thought it would be important to inform the 
campus of our plans for the Vice Chancellor's portfolio as early as 
possible, and I am writing now to provide you with that information.  

Last year, Vice Chancellor Colbert consolidated and reorganized facilities 
services.  Consistent with campus goals to accommodate to current budget 
realities and implement better business and administrative practices, he 
and I have continued working together to expand what he started.  After 
discussions with the Vice Chancellor, his staff members and others, I have 
determined that we will not replace the vice chancellor position effective 
July 1, 2003; instead we will realign the remaining units in his 
portfolio.  The realignment will permit us to reduce administrative costs, 
offer current staff members different administrative opportunities, and 
will provide the campus with assistance in critical areas.

O.J. Clark, currently Director of Public Safety, will be appointed 
Executive Director of Public Safety and will join the Chancellor's 
Cabinet, as will Jack Dempsey, who will be appointed Executive Director of 
Facilities and Services.  The other units and functions in the portfolio 
will be absorbed by these two administrators and our current Vice 
Chancellors.  Details of the reorganization can be found at 
http://www.vcadmin.uiuc.edu/.

Please join me in thanking Vice Chancellor Colbert for his service.  We 
will be celebrating his tenure with us in a more formal way later this 
year.

Cordially,

Nancy Cantor

RE:	Nominations for Honorary Degrees for May 2004 Commencements

The Senate Committee on Honorary Degrees is pleased to invite nominations 
for the May 2004 honorary degree awards.  Nomination procedures are 
detailed below.   You are urged to nominate, through your unit, 
outstanding candidates for Honorary Degree awards.  

The committee requests that nominations and supporting materials for the 
May 2004 commencement be submitted by February 28, 2003.  The Committee 
urges all units contemplating submitting a nomination to begin their 
preparation as soon as possible.  Please note that in order to maintain 
absolute confidentiality and avoid possible embarrassment to the candidate 
and to the University in case of lack of approval, under no circumstances 
is any potential candidate to be contacted even to obtained lists of 
references and/or vitae.  You may contact her/his secretary, colleague, 
etc., swear the person to absolute secrecy and obtain such a list. Only 
the President and/or Chancellor may contact candidates.

The Committee appreciates your help in identifying outstanding individuals 
whom the University can honor and, in so doing, honor itself.  If you have 
any questions or need additional information, please contact the Senate 
Office (333-6805).  For your convenience, a nomination form is at: 
http://www.uiuc.edu/providers/senate/hd_form.html


REQUEST FOR NOMINATIONS FOR HONORARY DEGREES

The prime, controlling consideration should be distinction.  The person 
should have made a distinguished contribution to knowledge and creativity 
in the relevant field of endeavor, and have shown sustained activity of 
uncommon merit.  The contributions may be made in a wide range of 
activities; the following list is not exhaustive:

-	Scholarship, in any discipline:  major breakthroughs in knowledge 
in fields of scholarly work.
-	Creative Arts, in the broad sense of the term:  literature, music, 
architecture, engineering, et al; the development of new frontiers of 
creativity.
-	Professions:  distinguished contributions, innovative work of 
distinction.
-	Public Service:  outstanding achievement in statesmanship, 
administration, legislative activity, the judiciary.
-	Business and Industry:  outstanding, innovative activity in the 
business community.

Following Senate guidelines, the Committee will consider, but not be bound 
by, the degree to which the candidate has had some association with 
Illinois - the University or the State.  While alumni of the University 
should not be excluded, honorary degrees are not a means of recognizing 
their contributions; other awards exist for this purpose.  Current 
administrators, faculty, or staff of the University ordinarily are not 
eligible; emeriti are eligible even if engaged in teaching or research at 
the University.  Elected officials of the State of Illinois and its 
subordinate units and members of the Legislature, during their terms of 
office, ordinarily are not eligible.

Senate guidelines emphasize recommendations by departments and other 
academic units.  A nomination coming to the Committee from a member of the 
Board of Trustees, an alumnus/alumna or friend of the University, will be 
referred to the proper academic unit for support of the faculty.

For full consideration by the Committee, the nominator or nominating unit 
should supply the following information to the Committee by February 28, 
2003:

1.     A brief letter of nomination, summarizing the candidate's 
qualifications for this honor, and certifying the support of the 
appropriate academic unit.

2.     A brief curriculum vitae of the nominee, including addresses, 
telephone numbers, or other means by which the nominee can be reached.  If 
the nomination finds substantial initial support in the Honorary Degrees 
Committee, additional information may be requested from the department to 
develop the case and to provide the Senate with the materials it needs for 
the final decision.

3.     The names and addresses of at least four professionally-
distinguished individuals who could be contacted for letters of support or 
further information about the candidate.  It is hoped that oral 
communications among professional colleagues will help assure the 
confidentiality of the decision process.

Nominations and full dossiers should be marked confidential and sent to 
the Committee on Honorary Degrees, c/o Senate Office, 228 English 
Building, MC-461.

Institute of Aviation is attempting to determine potential support from 
the University for the new route.  Delta has said that indications from 
faculty and staff will be essential to their decision regarding Champaign-
Urbana.

The proposal being discussed is regional jet service to Cincinnati, 
providing connections throughout Delta's extensive route network.  Key 
connections among the 100+ cities Delta serves from their Cincinnati hub 
include Atlanta, New York, Washington D.C., Chicago, Boston, Dallas, 
Philadelphia, Tampa and Orlando, among others.  Prices would be 
competitive with fares charged at nearby airports on routes of similar 
distance.

Additional information about Delta can be found at the following web 
sites:

http://www.delta.com/home/press_url/dal_stats_facts/index.jsp
 
http://www.delta.com/skymiles/member_guide/index.jsp
 
Please let us know if you would support this service by sending an email 
to:  jandersonm@khgroup.com.

1.  Would you find non-stop jet service to Cincinnati and Delta's route 
network useful?
2. How often would you use the service (estimated number of trips per 
year)?
 3. The following link illustrates Delta's extensive route network via 
their Cincinnati hub.  Delta mainline, partner routes, and top 50 
destinations may be accessed by the tabs within the spreadsheet.

Dear Colleagues:

	As the semester ends and we make plans for holiday celebrations 
and family gatherings, Joan and I extend our warmest wishes to you.
	This has been an extraordinarily difficult year, not only for 
this great university, but also for the entire state of Illinois and, 
indeed, much of the nation. However, this is not the moment to detail the 
negative impacts of a sluggish economy or the uncertainties of life in a 
post-9/11 world.
	This is the moment to express my deep gratitude to all members of 
the University of Illinois family for whatever role you fulfill in making 
this university operate at the highest level. As teachers, scholars, 
researchers, program associates, extension advisers, electricians, 
secretaries, librarians, nurses, curators, janitors, and so on--an 
amazing assemblage of good men and women--you make this university 
succeed in so many ways.
	The calendar year draws to a close, but we are only halfway 
through the academic year. Our challenge is to remain optimistic through 
next spring; our students, our patients, and others who rely on us must 
be served.
	Again, thank you for your good work. Have a peaceful and joyous 
holiday season and a healthy and happy new year.


James J. Stukel

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Brown v. Board of Education Commemoration and RFP","Dear Colleagues,

Several years ago the Campus Committee on Diversity made several important 
recommendations to the campus leadership.  Among those recommendations was 
that the campus make a special effort to commemorate the 50th anniversary 
of the U.S. Supreme Court's monumental decision in Brown v. Board of 
Education.  On May 17, 1954, the Court handed down its decision finding de 
jure segregation to be unconstitutional. 

I was particularly struck by the Diversity Committee's recommendation 
regarding Brown.  The Brown decision was one of the great defining 
landmarks of the twentieth century.  It seems fitting for our institution 
and community to devote the 2003-2004 academic year to events and 
activities that both celebrate the great strides that have flowed from the 
Brown decision and the unfinished work that remains before us. 

Last year I asked Dean Susan Fowler of the College of Education and 
Professor Thomas Ulen of the College of Law to co-chair a committee to 
coordinate the campus and community events commemorating Brown in the 2003-
2004 academic year.  They have assembled a Steering Committee -- Reg 
Alston, Kathryn Anthony, Rene Bowser, Vernon Burton, Walt Harrington, 
Masumi Iriye, Sarah Mangelsdorf, Larry Parker, and Kathy Perkins.  The 
Committee has already made great progress in planning events for the 
coming academic year.  Committee representatives have met with leaders of 
every campus college and most administrative units to discuss and 
coordinate ways in which the entire campus can be involved in this 
initiative.  You will be hearing from the Committee periodically about 
their activities, and you will be able to check on the Brown Jubilee 
Commemoration after December 16 at the following website: 
http://www.admin.uiuc.edu/brown_jubilee. 

As this semester draws to a close, I want to alert you to one of the first 
campus-wide activities of the Committee -- a Request for Proposals for 
scholarly and creative projects.  The Committee is soliciting proposals 
from faculty, students and staff for projects that address scholarly 
aspects of the Brown v. Board of Education decision broadly defined to 
include not only educational access, but also other aspects of democracy 
and social justice in this country and globally. Grants ranging from 
$5,000 to $20,000 will be made available on a competitive basis to fund 
research projects, lecture or seminar series, creative arts exhibits, 
works or performances, workshops, panel discussions, or other 
scholarly/creative works. 

If you would like further information on the RFP or on the work of the 
Brown Jubilee Commemoration Committee, please contact Rose Ann Miron at
ramiron@uiuc.edu. 

After December 16 you may download the RFP from the Brown Jubilee 
Commemoration website(http://www.admin.uiuc.edu/brown_jubilee)in pdf 
format. As you will see, the proposals must be delivered to Ellen Foran in 
the  Office of the Chancellor by 5:00 pm on Friday, February 14.  A 
special committee will evaluate the proposals and announce its decisions 
by March 15, 2003.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Recent Campus Attacks","Don't Become a Victim!!

	If you walk alone after dark, you are at risk for becoming the 
latest victim in a string of attacks against students in the University of 
Illinois campus area.  Since the start of the fall semester nearly two 
dozen women-many of Asian heritage-have been attacked and robbed while 
walking alone at night.
	In most cases, the attacker or attackers approached the woman from 
behind and used a silver handgun demanded money.  While police work to 
solve these cases, it is critical that you use extra caution to protect 
yourself.  NEVER walk alone after dark.  Instead, use the campus resources 
designed to keep you safe:

*Find a friend to walk with you and always use well-lighted routes.
*Call the recently enhanced SafeRides (at 265-7433), which will now 
offers door-to-door service from 5:30 p.m. until 6:00 a.m.  The service 
also will be in operation the week of fall break, except for Thanksgiving 
night.
*If you must be out after dark, call campus police at 333-1216 to 
arrange for an escort to walk with you. 

Do your part to help protect yourself:

*Pay attention to your surroundings: check out stairways and 
building entrances before entering them.
*Always be alert: remember to look behind you occasionally, never 
use headphones while you walk, and conceal your purse whenever possible.
*If you have a cellular phone, always carry it with you, and be 
ready to dial 911, if you have an emergency.
*If you are attacked, turn over whatever property the attacker 
requests, then call 911 as soon as you can get to a telephone.
*Take a Rape Aggression Defense course to learn to self defense 
tactics and techniques.  Call Officer Ortiz at 333-1216 for more 
information or to enroll.

Do your part to protect your fellow students:

*Keep your porch light on from dark till dawn and encourage your 
neighbors to do the same, to ensure that others have a well-lighted route.
*Call 911 immediately, if you notice any suspicious activity or 
people.
*Use the blue emergency phones across campus to reach police, if 
you do not have a cellular phone.  To learn the locations of the emergency 
phones along your route, call Mark Briggs at 333-4660 or look at page 102 
of the Student-Staff Directory.
*If you hear a whistle being blown, call 911 immediately, and blow 
your own whistle, if you have one.  To get a whistle, call the Office of 
the Dean of Students at 333-0050.
*If you're interested in joining the student patrol division, call 
Officer Johnson at 333-1216.

University police have increased patrols in the campus area and have 
formed a special task force with Champaign and Urbana police to 
investigate the recent attacks, but it is vital that each member of the 
campus community do everything he or she can to be safe.

The Athletic Board serves as an advisory committee to the Chancellor and 
the Athletic Director on the fiscal and operational aspects of the varsity 
sports program.  The Board is also responsible for that program as it 
relates to the academic and educational objectives defined by the Senate.

The Committee on Committees is seeking nominations from qualified faculty 
members to fill three (3) vacancies on the Athletic Board, created by the 
expiration of the terms of Lawrence DeBrock and William OBrien.  In 
addition, Charles Terry will be resigning from the Board for personal 
reasons at the end of this academic year.

Faculty members serve four-year terms.  The following faculty (with 
expiration of terms in parentheses) are continuing on the Board:

Kal Alston, EDUC (2006)
Susan Cohen, CBA (2005)
Kathleen Conlin, FAA (2006)
Jerome Packard, LAS (2004)

At the February 17, 2003, Senate meeting, the Committee on Committees will 
present a slate of six faculty nominees.  Upon Senate approval of the 
slate, the Chancellor will appoint three of these nominees, two for four-
year terms and one to serve the remaining two years of the term of 
Professor Terry.

We invite you to make nominations; faculty may also self-nominate.  
Nominations must include a brief (1-2 paragraph) description of the 
qualifications of the nominee, including reference to:

(1)  strengths in service and leadership,
(2)  major teaching and scholarly interests and accomplishments, and
(3)  experiences and interest in the policy and management issues that 
surround a Big Ten athletic program.

Thank you for your assistance; we look forward to receiving nominations.

Instructors of classes at the University may be confronted with conflicts 
between examination schedules and the religious beliefs and practices of 
their students. The Code of Policies and Regulations Applying to All 
Students (http://www.uiuc.edu/admin_manual/code/index.html) provides 
guidelines regarding scheduling of exams and accommodation of a student's 
religious beliefs (see Rules 24, 82 and 83). The Code stipulates the 
University must reasonably accommodate a student's religious beliefs, 
observances, and practices in regard to the scheduling of final, evening, 
and midterm and hourly examinations.  It further stipulates it is the 
responsibility of the student to inform the instructor of the conflict. 
Notification to the instructor should be provided within one week of the 
student being informed of the examination schedule. The student retains 
the right to appeal an instructor's adverse decision to the head of the 
department that offers the course.

The Internet provides instructors with a variety of calendars, which may 
be used as an aid in the planning of examinations. One such calendar is 
available at http://www.interfaithcalendar.org/2002.htm.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Critical Research initiatives-Preproposals","TO:  UIUC Faculty

From:  Charles F. Zukoski
       Vice Chancellor for Research



Introduction

       The long-standing tradition of excellence on this campus is based on
investment in outstanding faculty who have the motivation and ideas to
create new and innovative directions.  The Critical Research Initiative
(CRI) Program, now entering its ninth year of competition, was established
to stimulate continued innovation and outstanding scholarship on this
campus.  

        The purpose of the CRI program is to facilitate formation of
collaborations and exploration of innovative ideas that will open new
directions, enhance the intellectual environment of the campus, and lead to
long-term support from external sources.  The CRI program also supports
research initiatives not yet ready for external funding or areas where 
there is presently little prospect for funding but initiatives that would 
improve the intellectual life on campus.  Novel interdisciplinary 
approaches and emergent programs are especially appropriate candidates to 
request support from the CRI program, although funding will not be 
restricted to such projects.  

Types of Proposals

        There are two types of proposals: 

        1) Planning proposal:  Amount of funding may be up to $10,000 for 
one year. Planning grants can be used to develop a new idea or strengthen a
collaboration that is expected to lead to significant growth in the future.

        2) Full-length proposal:  Amount of funding may be up to $200,000 
over two years.  These grants are used to support major research 
activities that are not sufficiently developed to obtain funds from 
external sources or in cases where external support is not available.  

Application Process

        There is a two-step process.  The first step is to submit a
three-page pre-proposal describing the concept of the planning or
full-length proposal.  It is important to consider the Review Criteria (see
below) during the preparation of the pre-proposal.  The amount of money
requested is to be stated on the cover page of the pre-proposal (see 
below).  A faculty committee will review these proposals.  The authors of 
the top pre-proposals will be invited to submit an extended proposal with 
supporting documentation.  Guidelines for the preparation of the extended 
proposal will be sent to the top applicants at the time of notification.  
Awards will be announced by April 1, 2003.  Funds are available by July 1, 
2003.  

Preparation of the Pre-proposal

         A) Cover sheet:  available on the Web at
            www.research.uiuc.edu/cri/application.asp.  The signature of
            the PI is the only signature required.  An additional page 
            can be used to list Co-PIs if necessary. 
         B) Content of the pre-proposal:  Describe the proposed
            new and novel scholarly activity.  State clearly whether the
            application is for a planning grant or for a full-length
            grant.  Discuss how the proposed activity will enhance
            existing area of scholarly strengths or develop areas
            where the campus has the prospect of attaining excellence.
            Describe the role and qualifications of the PI and Co-PIs.
            Note:  Single investigator proposals will not be considered.
            The pre-proposal should not exceed three typed pages (single
            space, 1-inch margin, and minimum of 12-point size).  Do
            not provide supplemental attachments. 
         C) Budget:  An estimated budget is adequate at the pre-
            proposal stage.  
         D) 17 copies of the above are due by 5:00 pm on Monday,
            November 4, 2002.


Review Criteria
        
The following questions will guide the review of the pre-proposals:

Does the pre-proposal....
        1  Describe proposed novel research or scholarly activities?
           (CRI is not intended to provide interim support of ongoing
           research or scholarly activities.)
        2) Describe activities that would enhance the scholarly
           environment of the campus?  (Existing activities should not be
           duplicated.)
        3) Address the adequacy of infrastructure (e.g., facilities,
           space, equipment, etc.) to accomplish the proposed activities?
        4) Discuss appropriateness of pursuing these activities on this
           campus?  (e.g., cite faculty expertise, collections,
           instrumentation, regional/national/global needs.)
        5) Discuss the significance of this activity in relation to
           activities elsewhere? (e.g., indicate novelty,
           uniqueness,competitiveness.)
        6) Discuss the longer-term prospects and implications of the
           proposed activities?
        7) Describe the qualifications of the investigators to pursue
           proposed activities?

CRI Review Committee

        The review committee consists of faculty from various disciplines,
chosen for their vision, scholarly excellence, and knowledge of the breadth
and depth of scholarship pursued on this campus.  The CRI Review Committee
is appointed by the Vice Chancellor for Research.  

        In the course of considering particular proposals, the CRI Review
Committee may request further information, suggest changes, consult with
others on this campus or elsewhere, and/or seek to meet with the
applicant(s), as it may deem helpful.  The CRI Review Committee will then
formulate recommendations for full or partial funding of those proposals it
considers most deserving of CRI support.  These recommendations will be
forwarded to the Vice Chancellor for Research for final disposition.  It is
anticipated that the requests received at the pre-proposal stage will
greatly exceed the funds available; however, funding probability will be
much higher for those selected to submit an extended proposal.

TO:    Faculty, staff, and students who conduct research

FROM:  Charles F. Zukoski
       Vice Chancellor for Research 


For compliance purposes, federal and state sponsors of research require 
that all faculty, staff, and students engaged in sponsored research be 
informed regularly about campus policies concerning research integrity.

The University-wide procedures for addressing particular instances of 
unethical conduct in research and publication are stated in the booklet 
POLICY AND PROCEDURES ON ACADEMIC INTEGRITY IN RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION. 
This document is available on the Web at

   http://www.research.uiuc.edu/ai/index.asp.

Under this policy, all members of the University community are expected to 
observe high standards of academic integrity and ethical behavior in 
research and publication. Any practice or conduct by a member of the 
University community that seriously deviates from those ethical standards 
for proposing, conducting, and publishing research that are commonly 
accepted within the professional community constitutes academic misconduct 
in violation of University policy. 

Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to:

   a. Fabrication or falsification of data, including intentionally 
misleading, selective, or deliberately false reporting of credentials or 
other academically related information; 
   b. Unacknowledged appropriation of the work of others, including 
plagiarism, the abuse of confidentiality with respect to unpublished 
materials, or misappropriation of physical materials; 
   c. Evasion of or intentional failure after notice by the University or 
federal, state, or another appropriate agency to comply with research 
regulations or requirements, including but not limited to those applying 
to human subjects, laboratory animals, new drugs, radioactive materials, 
genetically altered organisms, and to safety; and 
   d. Other conduct which seriously deviates from accepted ethical 
standards in scholarship.

Differences of interpretation or judgment or honest error do not 
constitute academic misconduct. 

A student or faculty member who believes that academic misconduct has 
occurred has several options for pursuing the matter informally. Most such 
problems can and should be resolved without resort to formal procedures, 
through consultation with an adviser, department or unit head, or the 
campus Research Standards Officer, Gary Eden, Associate Vice Chancellor 
for Research.

If you have questions about this policy, please contact Professor Eden or 
Dr. Melanie Loots at 333-0034 or send e-mail to rsofficer@uiuc.edu

victims whom they select from profiles provided by the families. The Sept. 
11 Memorial Service Projects initiative was begun by a group of victims' 
family members, and the community service projects will be commemorated in 
a Web-based searchable scrapbook for the families' viewing.  Participants

Dear Colleagues:

Welcome to what promises to be another exciting year at the University of 
Illinois. Whether you are a newcomer or a longtime faculty or staff 
member, you are an important part of what I am confident will be an 
invigorating--albeit challenging--school year.

Once again, our campuses in Chicago, Springfield, and Urbana-Champaign 
have attracted bright and ambitious students, be they high school 
graduates, advanced-degree candidates from across the world, or part-
timers making a midcareer shift. Almost unnoticed, we continue to build 
enrollment in our virtual campus, University of Illinois Online, which 
brings together and helps support the Internet courses and programs our 
campuses offer. We expect more than 66,000 students to flood our campuses 
and thousands more to join us in less traditional learning opportunities, 
from Saturday art schools to executive MBA programs.

Fortunately, most of our senior leadership is in place. These men and 
women--and, in fact, all of you--will be asked to do more with less this 
year in order to mitigate the impacts of a tighter state budget. We have 
promised our students that we will try hardest to protect the elements of 
a University of Illinois education most important to them and critical to 
their development as learners and leaders. Those elements include good 
classroom instruction, well-supplied labs, competent academic advising, 
essential student services such as health care and counseling, well-
stocked library shelves and accessible databases, and buildings that are 
clean and well lighted.

These essentials are most vulnerable to the downturn in the Illinois 
economy that has left us with less state money than we received last 
year. About a third of our day-to-day operating budget comes from 
Illinois taxpayers, through the legislative process. It is, however, the 
essential third that allows us to open our doors every day; puts faculty 
in front of classes, janitors in the hallways, doctors and nurses in the 
hospital, secretaries in the offices, and librarians in our multitude of 
libraries; turns the lights on; heats and cools our buildings; and so 
forth. It leverages the research that is key to our reputation and our 
contributions to the arts and sciences, technological advances, and 
economic development in Illinois and beyond. Furthermore, it is our 
direct link to the people of Illinois who support us, send their sons and 
daughters to us, and use our services, such as Extension, summer science 
and band camps, and community building.

Despite the challenges this year presents, we expect to move ahead on 
many fronts. Universities, by their nature, are places of spirit and 
optimism, fueled by good ideas, imagination, and, ultimately, hard work. 
I ask for your special commitment this year to help the University of 
Illinois prosper and be strong. We have experienced down cycles before--
about every decade or more--and know that we must move firmly against the 
inertia that could attend a budget slump.

Thank you for your service to this great university. Joan and I wish each 
of you a most productive and fulfilling year.

James J. Stukel

Re: Employment Verification System

Are you applying for a home loan or mortgage?  Did you know that your 
lender can access your employment verification information almost 
immediately?

By using the University of Illinois online Employment Verification System, 
vendors such as banks, mortgage lenders, and housing management firms can 
have access to your employment verification information almost immediately 
and process your loan application or housing request much faster!

Follow these simple steps:

1. Access NESSIE at http://nessie.uihr.uillinois.edu/ and select *Your 
File*.
2. Select *Employment Verification* and follow the on-screen instructions 
to create up to five Vendor Access Numbers (VANs).
3. Determine a level of authorization: You decide how much information the 
vender may access, *Employment Verification Only* or *Employment and 
Earnings Verification*.
4. Provide your bank, lender, or housing manager with the VAN you created 
(must be used within 30 days) and your Social Security Number.
5. The lender can then access your Employment Verification online at 
https://hrnet.uihr.uillinois.edu/tiger/ 

All University employees are encouraged to use the online Employment 
Verification System. Using the online system eliminates the longer 
processing time associated with paper requests, resulting in better 
service to you.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Honorary Degree Nominations - May 2003 and 2004","DATE:  August 19, 2002
TO:    UIUC Senators, Deans, Directors, Faculty
FROM:  Harry H. Hilton, Chair, Senate Committee on Honorary Degrees
RE:    Nominations for Honorary Degrees for May 2003 and 2004 Commencements

The Senate Committee on Honorary Degrees is pleased to invite nominations 
for the May 2003 and 2004 honorary degree awards.  Nomination procedures 
are detailed below.   You are urged to nominate, through your unit, 
outstanding candidates for Honorary Degree awards.  

Although nominations will be considered throughout the year, the committee 
requests that nominations and supporting materials for the 2003 
commencement be submitted by September 30, 2002, and for the 2004 ceremony 
by October 28, 2002.  The Committee urges all units contemplating 
submitting a nomination to begin their preparation as soon as possible. 

Please note that in order to maintain absolute confidentiality and avoid 
possible embarrassment to the candidate and to the University in case of 
lack of approval, under no circumstances is any potential candidate to be 
contacted even to obtain lists of references. You may contact her/his 
secretary, colleague, etc., swear the person to absolute secrecy and 
obtain such a list. Only the President and/or Chancellor may contact 
candidates.

The Committee appreciates your help in identifying outstanding individuals 
whom the University can honor and, in so doing, honor itself.  If you have 
any questions or need additional information, please contact the Senate 
Office (333-6805).  For your convenience, a nomination form is at: 
http://www.uiuc.edu/providers/senate/hd_form.html

REQUEST FOR NOMINATIONS FOR HONORARY DEGREES

The prime, controlling consideration should be distinction.  The person 
should have made a distinguished contribution to knowledge and creativity 
in the relevant field of endeavor, and have shown sustained activity of 
uncommon merit.  The contributions may be made in a wide range of 
activities; the following list is not exhaustive:

* Scholarship, in any discipline:  major breakthroughs in 
knowledge in fields of scholarly work.

* Creative Arts, in the broad sense of the term:  literature, 
music, architecture, engineering, et al; the development of new frontiers 
of creativity.

* Professions:  distinguished contributions, innovative work of 
distinction.

* Public Service:  outstanding achievement in statesmanship, 
administration, legislative activity, the judiciary.

* Business and Industry:  outstanding, innovative activity in the 
business community.

Following Senate guidelines, the Committee will consider, but not be bound 
by, the degree to which the candidate has had some association with 
Illinois - the University or the State.  While alumni of the University 
should not be excluded, honorary degrees are not a means of recognizing 
their contributions; other awards exist for this purpose.  Current 
administrators, faculty, or staff of the University ordinarily are not 
eligible; emeriti are eligible even if engaged in teaching or research at 
the University.  Elected officials of the State of Illinois and its 
subordinate units and members of the Legislature, during their terms of 
office, ordinarily are not eligible.

Senate guidelines emphasize recommendations by departments and other 
academic units.  A nomination coming to the Committee from a member of the 
Board of Trustees, an alumnus/alumna or friend of the University, will be 
referred to the proper academic unit for support of the faculty.

For full consideration by the Committee, the nominator or nominating unit 
should supply the following information to the Committee by September 30, 
or October 28, 2002, as indicated above:

1.     A brief letter of nomination, summarizing the candidate's 
qualifications for this honor, and certifying the support of the 
appropriate academic unit.

2.     A brief curriculum vitae of the nominee, including addresses, 
telephone numbers, or other means by which the nominee can be reached.  If 
the nomination finds substantial initial support in the Honorary Degrees 
Committee, additional information may be requested from the department to 
develop the case and to provide the Senate with the materials it needs for 
the final decision.

3.     The names and addresses of at least four professionally-
distinguished individuals who could be contacted for letters of support or 
further information about the candidate.  It is hoped that oral 
communications among professional colleagues will help assure the 
confidentiality of the decision process.

Nominations and full dossiers should be marked confidential and sent to 
the Committee on Honorary Degrees, c/o Senate Office, 228 English 
Building, MC-461.

Dear Colleagues:

	
     I am pleased to announce good news received from the governor's 
office on our capital projects. Late last week, the governor signed the 
capital appropriation bill, which included the following items for the 
University of Illinois:

* $10.7 million for capital renewal at all three campuses
* $15.0 million for the Classroom Office Building at UIS
* $25.0 million for the College of Medicine building at UIC
* $57.6 million for the construction of a Chemical Sciences Building at 
UIC
* $18.0 million for the Microelectronics Lab expansion at UIUC

     The efforts of all of those involved in securing the appropriations 
were well rewarded. These projects total $126.3 million in new capital 
appropriations. Each of them is vital to the future of the university. I 
would like to thank the governor and legislature for investing in the 
long-term health of the university.

     There are other significant steps that must be taken before 
construction begins. The funds need to be released, and design and 
programming work still needs to be completed, but I wanted to notify you 
of this important milestone for the institution.

Dear Colleague:

I am pleased to announce that the Board of Trustees at last Thursday's 
meeting approved my recommendation of Thomas Hardy as the new executive 
director of the Office of University Relations, formerly the University 
Office of Public Affairs.  Tom is a seasoned public relations 
professional who will bring significant experience to this position.

He comes to the U of I from the Chicago office of Burson-Marsteller 
public relations, where he is a managing director of public affairs.  
Previously he served as press secretary to Governor Jim Edgar and worked 
twenty years at the Chicago Tribune as a reporter, columnist, and editor. 
For ten of those years he was the paper's chief Chicago political writer.

The Office of University Relations works with the President, the Board of 
Trustees, and senior university officers to address issues at the 
Chicago, Springfield, and Urbana-Champaign campuses.  In addition to 
overseeing this office, Tom will lead a communications management 
committee that will combine the talents and advice of communications 
professionals from the three campuses, as well as the Alumni Association 
and the University Foundation.

Tom, who will be based in Chicago, will start work August 1.

Please join me in welcoming Tom Hardy to the University of Illinois 
family.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Budget Message to the Campus Community","Dear Colleagues,

With the Board of Trustees' approval of the tuition increase last week, 
the long process of determining our budget for next year is coming to a 
close.  

As you probably read in the newspapers, the $14.8 million budget cut for 
our campus forecast in our January letter to you has turned out to be 
$40.49 million (out of a cut to the UI system of $89 million).  As a 
result, we must make reductions that are large, will affect most every 
unit on campus, and will have real consequences.  We want to share with 
you the strategy we are following in making these cuts, how the strategy 
was developed, and what it will mean for all of us.

We began planning for these cuts last fall.  We consulted with students in 
town meetings about tuition policy and in discussions with the student 
Tuition Policy Advisory Committee.  We sought the advice of the faculty 
Campus Budget Oversight Committee and the Deans' Budget Committee, and we 
consulted with the deans throughout the planning process.  There emerged 
from these discussions a set of priorities that would guide our planning.

High priority was given to protecting the institution's excellence and 
stature by preserving its ability to attract and retain superb faculty 
members, its capacity for renewal and innovation by supporting new 
initiatives that can make signal contributions, and maintaining a research 
environment that nurtures scholarly achievement at the highest levels.  
High priority also was given to coping with budget cuts in ways that would 
maintain the quality of our educational programs and preserve students' 
timely access to courses needed to meet degree requirements and to 
graduate on time.  The campus' engagement with the state's citizens, 
communities, public agencies, and businesses was given priority as well, 
along with the need to maintain essential services for students, public 
safety, and equal opportunity programs.  We have also given priority to 
financial aid for students for whom the higher tuition would be a 
hardship, as we pledged to the students in our discussions with them about 
a possible tuition increase.

To protect these priorities as much as possible, we devised a budgetary 
strategy.  The first element of the strategy was the decision to make 
differential budget cuts, allocating lower cuts to units whose work most 
directly affects these campus priorities.  As such, academic units 
received lower cuts (average of 6%) than administrative and service units 
(average of 7.5%).  Among academic units, lower cuts were made to budgets 
of units where priorities of research excellence and major instructional 
responsibilities intersect, where engagement with pressing societal needs 
is fostered, and where the institution is investing in initiatives and 
opportunities.  The University Library's centrality to the campus' 
missions and standing, and its value as a public resource were recognized 
with a cut of only 1.5%, and no cuts were made to essential programs 
including graduate fellowships, the Division of Rehabilitation Education 
Services, and the Council on Teacher Education.  

Similarly, within the administrative and service units, cuts were made 
differentially based on the units' centrality to these campus priorities.  
No cuts were made to the McKinley Health Center, the Principal's Scholars 
Program, University High School, the Campus Honors Program, the Office of 
Equal Opportunity and Access, or the Division of Public Safety because of 
the importance of their special roles.  The essential contribution of 
Student Affairs units to serving students' needs and interests was 
recognized with a cut of only 3.14%.  

The second element of the budgetary strategy was a decision to use all 
available resources to mitigate the immediate damaging effects of the 
budget cuts and provide a ""soft landing"" that would allow the cuts to be 
absorbed over a period of time.  This approach mirrored the campus' use of 
more than $8M in reserves to help cover the FY02 rescission, and it became 
the institution-wide financial strategy.  At all levels of the institution-
the campus, the colleges, individual departments and units-every effort 
would be made to ameliorate the most harmful immediate effects of the cuts 
on the campus' core missions by reallocating all available resources to 
cover a portion of the necessary reductions where possible in the short 
term.

The third element of the budgetary strategy was a decision to use new 
resources strategically to support our highest priorities.  The new funds 
provided by the additional 5% tuition increase approved last week were 
allocated in a way that allowed the budget cuts to units to be made 
differentially, directing support to campus priorities.  Additionally, 
most of the funds generated by the FY03 tuition surcharge ($5.7 million) 
have been allocated to provide educational enhancements recommended by the 
student Tuition Policy Advisory Committee and identified as targets for 
investment in our covenant with the students concerning how surcharge 
funds would be used:  access to General Education courses, access to high-
demand majors and essential courses, library operations and services, 
vital student services, graduate fellowships, critical campus network 
maintenance, and essential classroom upgrades.  Using new funds in these 
ways will allow us to continue to move ahead despite the budget cut in 
areas that are most critical to our educational and research missions.  

We believe that this strategy for absorbing our budget cut will protect 
our core missions and activities to the extent possible.  Difficult 
decisions had to be made at all levels of the institution, decisions that 
no one wanted to make but could not be avoided.  They were made in a 
principled way, based on our priorities for the present and future of this 
campus.  Above all, we have sought to protect this institution's 
exceptional quality and make sure that it continues to be the kind of 
university that drew us all here.  But there is no denying that however 
much we wish otherwise, the budget cut will have costs to our people and 
our programs.  

Our students will pay higher tuition next year.  They will have fewer 
courses to choose from, and seats may be harder to find in their desired 
courses at their desired times.  In many areas, class sizes will be 
larger, and fewer elective courses will be taught.  Our resources to 
support research will be constrained, and our public engagement will be 
reduced.  The salary freeze will prevent our recognizing in a tangible way 
the exceptional accomplishments of our faculty and staff during the past 
year.  The most bitter consequence of all will be the loss of valued 
employees.  The size of our faculty will be reduced by approximately 75 
colleagues through normal attrition over the next couple of years.  Most 
reductions to other employee groups also will occur through attrition, but 
a number of terminations and layoffs will be necessary.  Indeed, this 
process has already begun.

The next several years will be challenging ones for all of us.  For our 
part, we will work energetically to bring new resources to the campus and 
manage our way through this financial crisis so that we emerge on the 
other side positioned to move ahead rapidly as new funds become 
available.  The excellence and dedication of all who work here are 
precious assets that have made this institution what it is.  This is 
perhaps our most valuable resource for coping with the stresses that this 
period brings.  The campus has for a long time been a wonderful place to 
make a career.  This downturn will not change that.  

The coming period will be a time of tight fiscal constraint and 
retrenchment in many areas, but it also must be a time of progress on some 
key fronts.  The ability to launch bold new ideas with early investments 
has led to some of our university's most important achievements, and we 
will continue to find ways to take advantage of exceptional opportunities 
and leverage quality across the campus.  We will find ways to fund 
strategic faculty recruitment and the retention of essential colleagues.  
And we will continue to encourage faculty members to come together to 
create new opportunities for achievement.  Our commitment to excellence 
through support of diversity, and opportunities to make signal 
contributions will continue to move the institution ahead along the paths 
we have laid out together.

Our university has long conducted its affairs by relying on the thoughtful 
judgments of decision-makers within the units - the heads of departments, 
schools, colleges, and administrative and service units.  Their tireless 
efforts in working with us over the last six months to craft our budgetary 
strategy have once again earned the trust we place in them.  And, the 
confidence we place in our outstanding faculty and staff has been earned 
many times over by your accomplishments and devotion.  We know that the 
last few months have been a time of uncertainty and anxiety, and we thank 
you for your continued dedication to one of America's great public 
universities.

Dear Colleague:

	Despite our best efforts, the University of Illinois must cope 
with its most severe budget situation in decades. To do so, your 
university needs your understanding and your help. 
	We are deeply disappointed, of course, at the outcome of the 
Illinois legislature's special session. And yet we fully understand, 
intellectually, that the Illinois state budget was so woefully out of 
balance that our friends and allies in the legislature would have to give 
way to fulfill Illinois's constitutional mandate for a balanced budget.
	This has been an extraordinary time; we have spent virtually the 
last eight months absorbing a series of cuts and cost shifts. Thanks to 
the good work of the chancellors, provosts, deans, directors, and 
department heads from the three campuses, we had prepared budget scenarios 
with ever-escalating reductions and more severe impacts. We did not 
believe--or want to believe--that our final FY03 appropriation would 
approach our worst-case scenario. It did.
	Simplest put: the University of Illinois has an $89 million 
problem. That problem consists of two direct cuts into our appropriation 
that total $49 million; a $25 million cost shift of health insurance; and 
a short list, totaling $15 million, of mandatory costs, such as federal 
Medicare payments, utility price increases, and liability self-insurance. 
The $89 million represents about 9 percent of our state support, which 
itself is about one-third of our total operating budget. 
	The one-third, however, is critical to our important missions. It 
supports our basic obligations to our students and the citizens of 
Illinois. It pays most salaries and wages; puts books in the libraries; 
heats, lights, and cools our buildings; and the like. In sum, it is the 
essential day-to-day operating fund for our three campuses and other 
University of Illinois sites across the state. 
	You will be hearing more from your chancellors and provosts in the 
coming weeks about the specific steps those leaders must take to manage 
our way through the next year. This is a great university with a proud 
tradition of keeping our heads up and moving forward against all 
challenges. I ask for your patience and goodwill and thank you for both 
your hard work and your loyalty.

Members of the University of Illinois Community:


The following news release, issued Monday, outlines how the university 
fared in the new state budget passed Sunday by the Illinois Legislature. 
It is now on the governor's desk for his review and possible eventual 
approval. More details and impacts will be known in the coming weeks and 
months.

Thank you for your support during these last several months, which have 
been particularly active as our FY03 budget was being determined.


James J. Stukel
President
uipres@uillinois.edu



**************************************************




	URBANA--University of Illinois President James J. Stukel today 
commended Gov. George Ryan and the Illinois General Assembly for crafting 
a workable budget in a tough fiscal environment and he pledged the 
university's entire leadership will work diligently to manage the 
university's finances effectively.
	The Illinois General Assembly approved a new state budget Sunday 
and sent it to Gov. George Ryan for his action. The U of I's appropriation 
of about $780 million stayed at the level first recommended by the 
governor in February, and then again on Memorial Day evening. 
	The university's operating budget was cut $25 million below the 
start of the FY02 budget and another $25 million must be shifted to absorb 
health insurance costs. In addition, the university faces $15 million in 
costs that cannot be avoided, such as energy, union contract wage 
increases, and liability insurance.
	""The $65 million impact on our day-to-day budget calls for 
creative and dedicated leaders to help this great university maneuver its 
way forward for the next year--and beyond,"" Stukel said. ""We believe that 
leadership is in place.
	""And, while this problem in our operating budget approaches 
historic levels, we know this university has overcome hard times before. 
We are resilient, and with the cooperation and goodwill of the Illinois 
family, we will overcome these obstacles, too."" 
	The capital budget, on the other hand, contained only good news 
for the University of Illinois. University of Illinois projects in the new 
budget include $10.7 million for repair and renovation at all three 
campuses, $15 million for the UIS classroom and office building, $25 
million for the College of Medicine in Chicago, $57.6 million for the UIC 
Chemical Sciences Building, and $18 million for the Microelectronics Lab 
expansion at Urbana-Champaign. Additionally, three projects at Urbana-
Champaign were reappropriated from last year: $67.5 million for the Post-
Genomics Institute, $27 million for the National Center for Supercomputing 
Applications, and $8 million for the technology incubator. 
	""The capital budget is a sure sign of faith in the future,"" Stukel 
said. ""Important in their own right, these projects have a strong symbolic 
value: they say that the university of Illinois will continue to grow 
deeper in the areas in which we already have the advantage of great 
strength.""
	Stukel said the campus chancellors, provosts, deans, directors, 
and department heads have spent the last six months on FY02 and FY03 
budget issues and that their continued leadership is essential to keeping 
the U of I moving ahead even in difficult times. He estimates some 600 
positions will be lost across the whole university. Most positions will be 
through attrition, but there have been and will be layoffs of staff.
	""State general tax support is the backbone of the university's day-
to-day operating budget,"" Stukel said. ""It is the essential third, 
however, in that it pays most salaries and wages for faculty and staff; 
puts books in the libraries and equipment in the labs; and powers our 
buildings at the Chicago, Springfield, and Urbana-Champaign campuses and 
at our off-campus sites, such as our extension offices, all across 
Illinois,"" he said.
	The University of Illinois, which enrolls more than 66,000 
students on campus, is labor intensive. Some 80 percent of the state-
funded portion of the university's operating budget is committed to 
salaries and wages and, in some academic departments, as much as 95 
percent of the budget is tied up in personnel. Earlier this year, Stukel 
announced a general hiring and salary freeze, with exceptions needing high-
level approval.
	""The magnitude of the cuts requires that we reach into our most 
valuable asset--our people--to help cover the loss,"" Stukel said. ""All of 
us who care about this university are deeply concerned about long-range 
effects and jeopardizing our competitive edge.""
	The university's Board of Trustees is scheduled to discuss a 
tuition increase soon that adds up to 7 percent to increases the board 
already endorsed for the coming school year: 3 percent at Chicago, 4 
percent at Springfield, and 5 percent at Urbana-Champaign. The total 10 
percent increase over the academic year just ending will generate about 
$17 million in net revenue; 25 cents of each new tuition dollar raised 
will be turned immediately into student financial aid so U of I students 
who are least able to pay the increase are essentially held harmless. If 
the additional tuition is not approved, the university will have to cut 
personnel more deeply.
	Stukel said the university cannot escape negative impacts on its 
essential educational mission. ""It is a clear-cut cause-and-effect,"" he 
said. ""Fewer faculty in the classrooms means fewer sections and fewer 
options for our students and other troublesome results. At our core we are 
educators, and it is this mission we will work hardest to protect.""
	Stukel thanked Gov. George Ryan, who is an ex officio member of 
the university's Board of Trustees, the House and Senate leaders, and the 
other members of the legislature for their support during the budget 
session and last-hour negotiations. He singled out for special thanks 
Reps. Rick Winkel of Champaign, Tom Berns of Urbana, and Bill Black of 
Danville and retiring Sen. Stan Weaver of Urbana.  
	""This session has been quite a challenge and we're grateful to 
have emerged where we have; we know the outcome could have been far worse. 
For those who stayed with us, we extend our deepest gratitude,"" he said.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Presmail","Dear Colleague:

	The close of the academic year signals the moment to thank you 
again for all your hard work in our classrooms and offices; for your 
ingenuity and creativity in labs, studios, and library carrels; and for 
whatever you did to advance the fine reputation of a great university.
	The University of Illinois, whose three campuses span an 
astonishing array of disciplines--agriculture to zoology, medicine to 
dance, engineering to business, languages to law--is fortunate to be 
grounded in generations of support from Illinois taxpayers, loyal alumni, 
and generous friends. We can call on a deep reservoir of respect and 
admiration. 
	But the realities of 2001-02 are harsh. A nation already in 
recession was staggered by the events of last September 11, and the 
economy spiraled downward further and faster than many had predicted. The 
state of Illinois, like most of the Midwest, is slow going into recession 
and slower coming out. 
	The state legislature, which is scheduled to wrap up its work at 
the end of this month, is still grappling with a $1.2 billion projected 
deficit. Competing proposals for budget cuts, tax increases, borrowing, 
etc., have surfaced. Virtually every proposed solution has significant 
downsides for the University of Illinois, which receives about 30 percent 
of its annual operating funds from state government. And fully 80 percent 
of those precious state dollars are used for salaries and wages. Our state 
appropriation is the bedrock of what we do: it supports our teaching, our 
libraries, our physical plant. It lets us turn the lights on in the 
morning, put professors in front of students in classrooms and labs, and 
clean the buildings at night. It includes a modest subsidy for our Chicago 
hospital and such public services as Extension. It is our 
basic ""household"" budget and is heavily committed year after year.
	This is not the time to detail the FY02 cuts--we've already lost 
$34 million--or to outline the various FY03 scenarios. Chancellors Sylvia 
Manning, Richard Ringeisen, and Nancy Cantor and I will continue to keep 
you informed as the state budget is approved and we calculate the full 
impact on the university and decide what we can do that will have the 
least deleterious effect on our core missions. Some months ago, as the 
magnitude of the Illinois budget problem became evident, we talked with 
our Board of Trustees about principles that would guide our budget-
reduction decisions. They include protecting the interests of our students 
and patients and making quality the most important factor.
	For now, I want you to know how grateful we are for your past 
year's service--whether you are a distinguished senior professor, a set 
designer, or a nurse or are ordering books in the library or trimming the 
hedges. I hope you will be patient in a trying time. While the net loss to 
our budget could approach historic levels, we know this university has 
overcome hard times before. We are resilient and will work our way back. 
In the meantime, I ask for your goodwill and cooperation. 
	On the brighter side, Joan and I wish you a good summer whether 
you are on or off campus.

- Use the MTD scheduled bus service or SafeRides service - call 265-RIDE 
(265-7433).

- Never walk alone, especially after dark.

- Always use well-lighted paths.

- If you observe any suspicious activity or people, call 9-9-1-1 from a 
campus phone or 9-1-1 from a non-campus phone.

- Remember that the more you drink, the easier target you will be for 
criminals.

- Make a note of the locations of the emergency phones around the campus 
so that if you ever become the victim of any crime, please contact the 
police immediately, so they can help you receive appropriate medical and 
emotional support.

Please remember that your personal safety should always be a priority.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - A Special Message from the Chancellor","I saw on Monday a piece of hate mail that was sent by a partisan of one of 
the sides in the Middle East conflict to a group of students supporting 
the other side.  It was appalling in its venom.   The issues in that part 
of the world touch all of us very deeply.  On this campus, there are many 
with personal ties, ties of family or friendship, ethnicity or religion, 
to those engulfed by that tragic conflict.  There is, therefore, always 
the threat that the bitter divisions of the Middle East can be replicated 
here, that the hatred and even the violence can take root here.

We all need to recall the terrible sense of violation we felt on September 
11 and the comfort we experienced when we came together as a community to 
support and affirm each other.  In the first few days that followed, a few 
lashed out in anger, and I asked for a recognition of our common 
humanity.  I make that plea again.

We must not let our sense of violation as a community turn us against 
those who may appear to be outsiders.  There are no outsiders.  Our common 
humanity is threatened by hatred and violence.

In the wake of September 11, we turned to each other.  We drew closer 
together as a caring community.  We must not let the tragic divisions 
between the Israelis and Palestinians divide us.  We must be very

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Graduate Student Senate Seats","April 10, 2002

Dear Graduate Student,

Your voice is an important part of this campus. Therefore we write to tell 
you that there are ten seats available for graduate students in the UIUC 
Faculty/Student Senate for the 2002-2003 term. Because student senators 
have a significant role in considering various policy issues affecting this 
campus, it is important for the graduate student body as a whole to have 
these seats filled. In the past, issues addressed by the Senate have 
included policies affecting intellectual property, campus budgeting 
priorities, the faculty tenure system, sexual harassment, guidelines on 
criminal history review for admission, and requirements for degrees and 
certificates.  

Normally, it is the responsibility of the Student Election Commission (SEC) 
to oversee the election of these positions. However, because the SEC has 
not made adequate effort to notify the graduate student population about 
these seats or the process for running for election, only one of the eleven 
seats was filled in the year's election. Therefore, GSAC has worked out an 
agreement with the Senate to act as the review committee to appoint 
graduate students to the remaining ten seats, as we have done in the past 
when similar oversights have occurred.

We strongly encourage you to consider taking this opportunity to serve on 
behalf of fellow graduate students and also to gain professional 
experience. Generally the Senate convenes once per month. Student senators 
are also eligible to serve on one of the Senate's standing committees. 
These, too, meet approximately once per month. Please make this small 
sacrifice of time to get involved, represent graduate students, and make a 
difference.  

To apply, send a letter of intent to serve and a resume via campus mail to: 
 
The Graduate Student Advisory Council
207 Coble Hall, MC 322.  

APPLICATIONS ARE DUE TUESDAY, APRIL 30th

The letter of intent should indicate your interest in this service 
opportunity, give your graduate or professional degree program, state your 
level in that program, and provide your telephone number or e-mail address. 
Senators will need to be enrolled students in fall 2002 and spring 2003, 
and must be in good academic standing.

If you have questions about applying, contact GSAC Coordinator Charlotte 
Bauer-Smith at gsac@uiuc.edu. For specific questions about the Senate, 
contact Senate Clerk Bob Damrau at senate@uiuc.edu.

Re:  NESSIE - Update your personal information

On February 18, the first UI-Integrate Banner module, 
Biographic/Demographic, was successfully launched. During the conversion to 
Banner, changes to your personal information may have occurred and should 
be validated to ensure the accuracy of information contained in your file.  
Any changes to your record can be viewed in the ""Employee Information Form"" 
found in the ""Your File"" section of NESSIE.  More specific detail regarding 
the types of changes that may have occurred follow: 

*Personal Information Changes* 
When the Biographic/Demographic information was implemented, your personal 
data was converted to a new format. As a result, some of your information 
may have been removed or changed to conform to the new Banner system 
requirements. Examples of data changes include but are not limited to the 
following:

Shortened information. For example, Work History position descriptions in 
Banner can only be 255 characters long. During the conversion, longer 
records were shortened. Depending on how you originally entered data, you 
may want to revise the condensed version of your record so it is complete.
 
Removed information. For example, Grade Point Average (GPA) was completely 
removed during the conversion. Banner only accepts a GPA on a 4.0 scale. 
Consider entering your GPA based on a 4.0 scale to include this information 
in your file. 

Omitted categories. For example, in the Certifications section of NESSIE, 
the Certification of Vocation Completion did not have a corresponding 
category in Banner. Records listing Certificate of Vocational Completion 
were removed and cannot be updated or reinstated.
 
Default gender codes.  Banner used a default gender of ""Female"" for any 
employee for whom gender data was not available in the previous system. 
Please review this information.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Budget Update","Dear Colleagues:

It has been two months since we wrote to you about the campus budgetary 
outlook, and we want to update you on recent developments.  Many of you 
probably saw news stories last week concerning what the effects of possible 
budget cuts might be on our campus and across the UI system.  Our FY03 
budget has not yet been finalized.  But recent events have given us a 
better idea of what to expect, and our planning for possible cuts-which was 
just beginning when we last wrote to you-is farther along now.  We want to 
share these expectations and plans with you so that you will know what the 
situation looks like as of this moment.

As you know, in December we were asked to take a rescission for the current 
year that turned out to be $15.2 million, of which the largest portion was 
health care costs that in the past have been paid by the State.  At that 
time, we expected that this amount would become a permanent cut to our 
State budget for next year.

After our January letter to you, the State's financial situation continued 
to deteriorate, making additional budget reductions necessary.  These 
additional reductions were incorporated in the Governor's proposed FY03 
budget, which was presented in February.  Also during this time, both the 
UI system and the campus worked on identifying unavoidable new costs-such 
as price increases for utilities, liability insurance, and higher Medicare 
costs-that we would have to find a way to pay regardless of how the 
State appropriation turned out.  The result became, in effect, a base 
budget cut to UIUC for next year of $29.9 million, which is the amount that 
we are now planning to absorb.

We have been working with the deans and the heads of our administrative 
units, and consulting with student and faculty groups to plan how to 
protect our highest priorities while absorbing the expected budget cut.  In 
doing so, we have been guided by the principles outlined in our January 
letter to you:  finding ways to cope with our short-term financial 
circumstance that continue our forward movement, build on our recent 
accomplishments if at a slower pace than had been hoped, and protect our 
missions of teaching, research, and public engagement.

One of the conclusions that emerged from this planning process has been 
that we should absorb as much of the expected budget cut as possible by 
using campus-level funds in order to reduce the cuts to campus units as 
much as we can.  In addition, we expect to provide a limited amount of 
nonrecurring funds for the first year or two so that units do not have to 
absorb the full cut in only one year.  The cost of using campus-level funds 
is that we will have much less capacity to support special needs and 
requests than we have been accustomed to in recent years.  For example, we 
are committing the preponderance of the remaining Faculty Excellence Funds 
to absorbing part of the budget cut.  

We cannot begin to absorb the entire reduction from campus resources, 
however, and substantial cuts will have to be made to the budgets of all 
units.  The cuts we face are serious, and much as we would wish otherwise, 
they will have human consequences.  Most of our budget is in human 
resources-the talented and dedicated faculty and staff members on whom our 
enterprise most depends.  Across all of our academic departments, an 
average of more than 95% of departmental budgets is committed to salaries. 
 Thus, it is unavoidable that there will be some reductions in the numbers 
of faculty and staff.  Naturally, we will try to absorb these reductions 
through the normal process of attrition as much as possible.  Faculty 
reductions will be accomplished through attrition, but there may have to be 
some staff layoffs.

Budget cuts of the size we expect will have impact across the campus.  As 
the budget picture continues to clarify, we will consult with the deans, 
the heads of our administrative units, with the faculty Campus Budget 
Oversight Committee, and others about how the cuts should be made.  Based 
on this broad consultation, we will decide how to proceed.  Our decisions 
will be principled ones, as we promised in our earlier letter to you, and 
as a result, cuts will be made differentially to protect our highest 
priorities and most important values.  

We will try to protect our core missions by cutting budgets of 
administrative units more than the budgets of the academic units.  We have 
asked administrative units to plan for cuts of 5.0% to 5.5%, and academic 
units have been asked to plan for cuts averaging 4.0% to 4.5%.  For 
planning purposes, we have used much of the yield of the proposed tuition 
increase to address the budget shortfall ""off the top.""  Distribution of 
the remainder of the tuition increase to the academic units will ameliorate 
the effect of the budget cuts there, though the necessary cuts remain very 
significant.  Cuts to academic and administrative units will not be made 
across the board, but rather will reflect careful appraisal of priorities 
and opportunities to move ahead in some key areas.

The plan we have described assumes approval of the additional 5% tuition 
increase that has been proposed.  Added to the 5% increase previously 
approved for next year, the total tuition proposal is for a 10% increase.  
The increase will allow us to protect the full yield of the tuition 
surcharge for allocation to the educational enhancements for which it was 
intended.  Surcharge funds will enable us to provide a number of new 
faculty positions and other programmatic improvements even as units are 
cutting their budgets.  By such means, we hope to be able to continue to 
make progress in a number of critical areas, as noted in our last letter to 
you, while at the same time preserving some capacity to act on new ideas 
and make critical cross-campus investments of the kind that have been so 
important to our success as an institution.

We know that the short-term outlook we have described raises concerns for 
the whole campus community, concerns that we fully share.  Our recent 
success-including this year an upturn in the number of faculty members for 
the first time in more than twenty years-has given us a solid foundation 
for withstanding the cuts that will have to be made.  The principles that 
are guiding our planning will, as we have described, allow us to continue 
to make progress on a number of fronts during this period as well as 
positioning the institution to move ahead dramatically when the State's 
finances begin to improve.  In the interim, we will continue to 
aggressively pursue opportunities for increased private foundation support, 
research funding, and other sources of revenue.

It is likely that we will not be making final decisions until late May or 
early June.  By that time the General Assembly will have enacted a budget, 
and we will know final tuition policy as well.  We will keep you apprised 
of any significant developments as we monitor the situation and continue to 
develop campus strategy for dealing with the reductions.

Very truly yours,

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Campus Budget/Tuition","Dear Students:
 
	You have probably read and heard a lot lately about budget cuts for 
the university and the possibility of increasing tuition to help make up 
for some of the lost funds.  We want to share with you the most recent 
information we have about this situation as it is unfolding, and also to 
invite your participation in a dialogue concerning these important issues. 

        Knowing that the proposal for a tuition increase and the general 
plan we have outlined for dealing with our financial situation raise issues 
that affect all students, we invite you to learn more about these issues 
and to express your views.  A Town Meeting on the subject will be held on 
Tuesday, January 29, 2002, from 5:00-6:00 p.m. in the Courtyard Cafe of the 
Illini Union.  We will participate, as will Orlo Austin, Director of 
Student Financial Aid.  Student Trustee Eamon Kelly will moderate the 
meeting.  The meeting will offer detailed information about the tuition 
proposal and provide a chance for you to raise questions and share your 
opinions.

	 Before getting into specifics, we want to emphasize that we will 
deal with our financial situation in ways that protect our missions of 
teaching, research, and public engagement.  We will continue to support the 
highest quality of education for our students.  We intend to make sure that 
the funds generated by the tuition surcharge are used for the educational 
enhancements that were promised when the surcharge was approved.  And, we 
will keep this institution moving forward as one of the nation's premier 
public research universities. 
 
	The budget problem we face is this:  Like other states across the 
country, state revenues in Illinois are falling significantly short of what 
had been expected.  As a result, the State will not be able to provide the 
full amounts that were appropriated this year for its agencies and 
operation, including higher education.  In our case, the campus will have 
to cut spending in the current year by $15.2 million.  Depending on how 
long the economy takes to recover, this situation is likely to continue 
into next year and beyond, although the outlook remains uncertain.  For 
planning purposes, we are assuming that next year's appropriation of State 
funds to our campus will be smaller than this year's allocation.

	Here is what we propose to do.  First, we will try to minimize the 
effect of this year's budget cut on our academic units and their teaching 
and research.  In order to do this, the campus administration will provide 
as much of the needed funds as possible.  By contributing campus reserves 
and other flexible funds, we will be able to furnish one-half of the total 
amount.  The other half will be provided by campus units reducing their 
expenditures.  We will protect the priority of our teaching, research, and 
public engagement missions by asking administrative and service units to 
reduce their expenditures for the year by 2.5% while academic units reduce 
their expenditures by 1.25%.  Because the University Library is central to 
the quality of the whole campus and there is a clear need for additional 
investment, the Library will not be required to cut its spending.  

	Second, we are trying to plan how to absorb a permanent budget cut 
next year in ways that protect our core missions, especially our ability to 
deliver the quality of education that brought you to this campus.  We have 
asked the deans and vice chancellors to consider how they can minimize any 
effects of permanent budget cuts on our programs of teaching and research. 
 We will work vigorously to increase fund-raising.  And finally, a proposal 
is being considered for increasing tuition next year by an additional 5%, 
or about $196 per year for undergraduates enrolled for a full program at 
the base tuition rate.  This increase would provide about one-fourth of the 
funds that we expect to lose to budget cuts next year.  The rationale for 
one-fourth is that tuition provides roughly one quarter of the university's 
funds that can be brought to bear on the budget problem.

	The idea of increasing tuition arose when it became clear that 
fund-raising, the campus administration, the colleges, and the 
administrative units cannot absorb the full budget cuts we are likely to 
face and at the same time protect our core missions to the extent we 
believe is essential.  There seems no alternative but to ask students to 
participate in a limited way in maintaining the quality of our programs.  
The increase that is proposed includes a plan to set aside almost 25% of 
the new tuition dollars for the purpose of providing increased financial 
aid to those who would see additional need as a result of the proposed 
raise in tuition. Such a set aside reflects our past policy and has proven 
very effective. 

	As you may know, many of our peer institutions face cuts deeper 
than ours.  The momentum that we have built up over the past several years 
may be slowed by these cuts in the short term, but we are determined that 
it will not stop.  To this end, we have just allocated funds from this 
year's tuition surcharge to the colleges.  With the advice of faculty and 
student advisory committees, we have provided support for new faculty 
positions, graduate fellowships, and advising.  

	Between now and March, when the Board of Trustees will vote on a 
tuition proposal, there will be a series of meetings with many student 
groups organized by Student Trustee Kelly and including other members of 
the student Tuition Policy Advisory Committee, who provided advice about 
allocating funds from the tuition surcharge and who have considered the 
university's financial situation in detail.  We also invite you to take 
part in these meetings and to offer your opinions and raise questions about 
matters of concern by e-mail to us at provost@uiuc.edu.
  
	We face serious challenges.  Working together, we believe these 
challenges can be met in a way that preserves the quality of your education 
and the special strengths of our university.  We look forward to discussing 
these matters in the coming dialogue about our financial situation and how 
best to deal with it.

Dear Colleague:

As you learn more about the financial difficulties we face as a nation, as 
a state, and as a university, I hope you will keep in mind that we are 
rich in the most important resource needed to help us weather this tough 
time:  our superb faculty and staff. And so it is to you that I turn today.

Our resilience is great. We have managed our way through cuts, recessions, 
and rescissions before.  This is not to understate the seriousness of a 
midyear cut of some $34 million (about 4 percent) into the existing 
state-supported part of our budget; it is our deepest cut in more than 25 
years. Nor should we understate the negative impact of that cut carrying 
into the FY03 fiscal year plus having to pay for ""unavoidables""--such as 
Medicare, hikes in property and liability insurance, operations and 
maintenance for new space, and utility-price increases. Our calculation of 
the FY03 problem today--assuming our cuts are permanent--tops $40 million, 
or about 5 percent of our state appropriation. And the Illinois economy 
has not yet turned around.

We discussed these issues at length with our Board of Trustees last week 
and talked with them about how we will manage. We said then that we believe
that our students, who gain so much in earning power and other benefits 
from a University of Illinois education, should pay one-fourth of the loss 
and that painful internal reallocation will cover the remaining
three-fourths.

I am sharing with you today a statement of principles that will guide the 
chancellors, provosts, and other leaders as they approach the wise 
management of spending reductions for both this year and next. Two 
concepts, ""quality"" and ""local control,"" are central to how we will 
accomplish what we must. You have my assurance that, as with all important 
matters, collegiality and consensus will prevail, but all will be held 
accountable.

Here is how we will approach difficult choices that must and will be made.

We will reexamine what is most central to the mission of this university, 
what must be protected, and where investments should be made.  The 
decisions will be made carefully in consultation with campus leaders and 
faculty. They will be based on our shared values and collective vision. We 
cannot afford to cut spending across the board or declare a moratorium on 
new-program development and initiatives. We must continue to move forward 
by capitalizing on new opportunities and ideas in ways that have played 
such an important role in making our university the great institution it 
is today. And we will.

But we also must be realistic.  To address these serious budget cuts we 
will have to reduce faculty and staff numbers through attrition, reduce 
some services, curtail some remodeling, reduce facility maintenance, and 
scale back or delay important academic program expansions. Inevitably this 
will lead to increased class sizes and may result in loss of momentum in 
significant new initiatives such as those in economic development, 
genomics, nanotechnology, and information technology. But that is the 
reality of the environment we face.

The following guiding principles will help the chancellors and other 
University of Illinois leaders manage the spending reductions for both this
year and next:

(1) The university will maintain its fiduciary responsibilities where laws,
rules, or regulations require. Examples: auxiliary operations where bond 
covenants exist; the hospital and clinics where Medicare/Medicaid and 
third-party payor requirements apply; research funded by federal, state, 
or industry contracts; and gifts restricted by donors.

(2) Quality will drive all decisions.

(3) We will insulate services to our primary clients, namely our students 
and patients. Our highest priority is to protect the quality of our 
undergraduate education programs. In particular, we will ensure that 
undergraduates can schedule classes so they can graduate on time.

(4) The university will plan for FY03 by anticipating a second difficult 
budget year. I want to be certain that we have sufficient resources to 
meet unavoidable spending increases for insurance, utilities price 
increases, and key academic programs such as the UIS Capital Scholars 
Program.

(5) We will protect the university's highest priorities, over time, 
although some key projects may be delayed in the short term.

(6) And once the Board of Trustees has approved the general boundaries for 
addressing these serious budget challenges, we will support decentralized 
decision-making that permits the chancellors, provosts, deans, and 
department heads to make the appropriate local judgments to best meet our 
education, research, and outreach objectives.

These principles are important guideposts, but the hard work of 
restructuring both this year's and next year's budgets requires good will 
and forbearance among the University of Illinois family.  We are important 
citizens in a strong state and so have to work through our share of 
Illinois's difficulty. This is not an easy task, but we surely are up to 
it.

Thank you for your help.

Reply-To: provost@uiuc.edu
 Subject: MASSMAIL - Campus Financial Picture","Dear Colleagues:

It was less than two months ago that we wrote to you, inviting you to join 
in a campus-wide dialogue to shape the future of our campus, to ensure 
academic excellence, to continue and expand our national leadership role.  
When we issued our invitation, the State's financial outlook was 
deteriorating, and we did not know how the campus' resources might be 
affected.  The near-term prospects for State revenues have clarified over 
the last few weeks. We want to share with you what we now know about our 
financial circumstance and describe how we propose to deal with the 
situation we face.  Before turning to specifics, however, we want to 
reiterate the conviction expressed in our earlier letter.  It is 
imperative, now more than ever, that we think as creatively as we can about 
scholarly and educational opportunities that will define our institution 
for the years to come.  As an institution facing some tight fiscal 
constraints, we, like many of our peers, do not have the luxury of feeding 
all of our aspirations. As a great institution, we also do not have the 
luxury of standing still, for we will slide back quickly if we pass up 
opportunities for investment in areas ripe for discovery.  We will need to 
be exceedingly clever and opportunistic in finding sources of support; 
nevertheless, we must redouble our commitment to moving forward.
    
With these thoughts in mind, we turn now to the details of our current 
budgetary outlook.  Like other states across the country, state revenues in 
Illinois are falling significantly short of what had been expected.  As a 
result, the State will not be able to provide the full amounts that were 
budgeted for its agencies and operation, including higher education, in the 
current fiscal year.  In our case, the campus will have to spend $14.8 
million less than we previously had budgeted for this year.  This reflects 
a university-wide number of $32.5 million.  The largest portion ($10.7 
million of the $14.8 million) of this shortfall results from the 
requirement that the campus pay a larger share of employee health care 
costs which in the past have been paid by the State.  All of this is likely 
to continue into fiscal year 2003, although the outlook remains uncertain. 
 We do not know what if any new funds will be available to us from the 
State for next year.
  
We thus face two different financial questions:  How shall we reduce 
expenditures in the current year by $14.8 million?  How shall we plan for a 
FY03 State budget that may well be somewhat smaller than this year's 
budget?
  
These questions arise at a time when our campus has gained considerable 
momentum across a broad front with important new programs and initiatives. 
 While the questions we face are financial, our answers to them must be 
grounded in institutional values and aspirations.  We must find ways to 
cope with our short-term financial circumstance that continue our forward 
movement, that build on our accomplishments of recent years if at a slower 
pace than had been hoped, and that protect our missions of teaching, 
research, and public engagement.  In order to accomplish these goals, we 
will have to make harder choices than in recent years.  Our campus has had 
to make such choices before, and in doing so we have become a stronger 
institution.  We must examine anew what is most important to our missions 
and our aspirations, what must be protected, and where investments must be 
made.  Our decisions must be principled choices based on our shared vision 
for this institution.  Among other things, this vision requires us to 
protect and enhance our library as a priceless asset, to realize the 
post-genomic initiative, to show leadership in general education and in the 
humanistic disciplines that support it, to create a truly diverse campus, 
to build our graduate fellowship support, and to preserve our capacity to 
act on new ideas and to make critical cross-campus programmatic 
investments.
  
The alternatives-to make no choices and instead reduce expenditures across 
the board; to declare a moratorium on programmatic development and 
initiatives-are not options for us.  They would mean separating our actions 
from our values, ignoring our own institutional history, turning our back 
on our aspirations, at least until times get better.  These are not the 
practices that brought us all to Illinois.  These are not the practices 
that will take charge of our institutional future.
    
Here is what we propose to do.  In order to minimize the effect of the 
current year's $14.8 million shortfall on our units, we will provide as 
much of the needed funds as possible.  By contributing campus reserves and 
other flexible funds, we will furnish one-half of the total amount.  The 
other half will be provided by campus units reducing their expenditures.  
They will not be asked to do so on an across-the-board basis, however.  
Rather, we will protect the priority of our teaching, research, and public 
engagement missions by asking administrative and service units to reduce 
their expenditures for the year by 2.5% while academic units reduce their 
expenditures by 1.25%.  The University Library will not be required to 
participate in this rescission.

As we have said, we do not know what the FY03 budget will look like.  The 
Governor will first put his budget before the legislature in February.  By 
that time, we hope to have a much better understanding of the State's 
fiscal picture.  For now, we are working with a range of scenarios 
including one based on the assumption that the FY03 campus budget will be 
smaller than the FY02 budget.  In that scenario, this year's mid-year 
reduction of expenditures would become a permanent cut in next year's base 
budget.
 
For FY03, we have asked the deans and vice chancellors to consider how to 
deal with base budget rescissions in ways that protect the core missions of 
the campus, including our ability to invest in areas of great opportunity. 
 Insofar as possible, we plan to continue to provide some cash relief to 
the units during at least FY03 in order to ease the effect of a base budget 
rescission.  In this way, our planning for next year will seek to allow us 
to continue to realize some of key initiatives already underway as well as 
some of those yet to be dreamt.

As you may know, a number of public universities began suffering cuts last 
year.  Many of our peer institutions face rescissions deeper than ours.  
Clearly, higher education nationally is in for a bit of a rough ride.  
However, it has been clear for many years that all universities, especially 
publics, need to diversify their approach to funding.  We took a step in 
this direction last year with a tuition rise and we expect private fund 
raising efforts to increase.  We are faced with a harder set of choices 
than we expected, and while the momentum that we have built up over the 
past several years will be slowed, we are determined that it will not stop. 
 To this end, we have just responded to unit requests for monies from this 
year's tuition surcharge.  With the advice of various faculty and student 
advisory committees, we have provided support for new faculty positions, 
graduate fellowships, and advising.  Our goals will include protecting 
those surcharge dollars, especially as they reflect a compact with our 
students, and the faculty excellence funds which have served us so well.  
This past year we hired 195 faculty and for the first time in twenty years 
our faculty numbers have increased (by 75).  Behind these numbers are 
wonderful individuals and significant programmatic expansion.  These are 
hard fought gains which must be retained.
  
We face serious challenges.  Working together, we believe these challenges 
can be met in a way that preserves the special strengths of our university 
and allows us to continue to make significant progress in areas that are 
most critical and rich in opportunity.

Very truly yours,

December 3, 2001


Dear Colleagues:

As we end the semester and make plans for the upcoming celebrations and 
family gatherings, my wife, Joan, and I would like to extend our warmest 
wishes to you for a restful and memorable holiday season.

Perhaps this December we are more aware than ever of how important family 
is and more appreciative of those we too often take for granted.

At the university, the sentiment is similar. Your earnest commitment to 
teaching and research and all the other supportive efforts that keep our 
university operating at top-notch quality is the reason we are one of the 
best universities in the world. The successes achieved on our campuses are 
diverse and far-reaching, yet all are directly attributable to the people 
who seek answers to the tough questions, who inspire students, and who 
make this university run so well. Thank you for making those efforts.

Looking back on 2001, we see that in one sense it has been a wonderful 
year. We have talented new chancellors on board with unbridled energy and 
high expectations for all the opportunities that lay ahead.

However, we sadly experienced a historic tragedy just weeks after the start
of the fall semester. Some of our faculty, staff, students, and alumni 
suffered personal losses and grief. Many struggled to understand. And the 
economic impact of the September events clouds some plans for the 
university in the coming year.

Whatever the outcome, I know with certainty that this university will 
continue to seek and provide excellence and be a haven for the kind of 
conversation and understanding needed in this new century. We have much to 
look forward to in the new year.

So our thanks and best wishes go out to you for a joyous and peaceful 
holiday season and a healthy and happy 2002.



James J. Stukel
President

 Subject: MASSMAIL - State Budget information","We write to share with you some of the content of Governor Ryan's recent 
budget announcement.  He has proposed a number of spending reductions for 
fiscal year 2002 totaling $220 million.  These reductions include postponing 
work on the Post-Genomic Institute.

We are disappointed, but we understand the enormous pressure the Governor is 
under to cut spending.  Some of the other actions he has taken include an 
unpaid furlough for state employees who report directly to him and cutting 
spending at the Department of Commerce and Community Affairs.

We are confident that the Governor and the Legislature agree with us on the 
importance of the PGI and we believe that the project will be brought back 
on line.  For the moment, we urge you to remain behind the Post-Genomic 
initiative and continue your efforts to keep this program moving forward.

Naturally, we will keep you informed as the situation develops.

*****************************************
I.  Course Description

The Human Genome Project and the knowledge resulting from it stand to 
transform fundamentally our understanding of how the human body and other 
living systems work.  Furthermore, decisions related to this new knowledge 
are likely to influence profoundly the future of humankind and other life 
forms on this planet.  We thus need to think very carefully about how we use 
the knowledge and tools that are becoming available to us.

In this course, taught as a discussion seminar, we seek to identify and 
envision the developments in the life sciences and medicine that promise to 
result from full knowledge of the human genome and other genomic sequences.  
Concomitantly, we will examine how this revolution in our knowledge of our 
genetic makeup is liable to intersect with other knowledge we have about 
ourselves, our institutions, our society, and our world.

	What's new about the New Biology?
	The New Biology: The view in 2002
	Actors and Interests in the Human Genome Project
	Eugenics: The New Biology of 1900
	Genetically Modified Organisms
	Xenotransplantation; Genetic Therapy; Genomics and Privacy
	Genomics and Race; Genomics and Behavior
	Biological Warfare and Bioterrorism
	The Remaking of Human Nature?

The seminar is open to juniors and seniors (enrolling in the course as

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Update:  Handling Letters and Packages","DATE:     October 25, 2001

TO:       Faculty and Staff

FROM:     Charles C. Colbert
          Vice Chancellor for Administration and Human Resources

SUBJECT:  SAFETY ALERT	


Update:  Handling Letters and Packages - Concerns about Anthrax

On October 23, the United States Postal Service (USPS) implemented several 
preventive measures to protect its employees from exposure to anthrax. 
This was done in response to the recent deaths of two USPS employees who 
worked in the Washington D.C. Brentwood Road facility. The USPS has begun 
providing all employees who process mail with masks and gloves for their 
protection knowing there is no definitive public-health answer about the 
level of protection these devices provide. 

With few exceptions, essentially all U.S. mail delivered to the Campus is 
by either Champaign or Urbana postal workers. Use of the personal 
protective equipment (PPE) is not mandatory but is being encouraged for 
USPS workers as the USPS continues to investigate potential anthrax 
contamination at several postal facilities in Virginia and Maryland.  
Individuals who have the responsibility for processing departmental mail 
need to exercise prudent practices described herein. 

The recently provided information on handling suspicious letters and 
packages (http://www.vcadmin.uiuc.edu/mail.html) remains the recommended 
guidance for Campus and should be followed. However, the Campus will 
continue to monitor the ongoing investigation and updated information 
being provided by the USPS and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) to ensure that the practices we recommend are consistent 
with those provided by those agencies.

An important component of the current guidelines is hand washing. Hand 
washing is frequently recognized as the single most important measure in 
reducing the risk of transmitting disease causing organisms. Therefore, 
the simple act of washing ones hands with soap and water following mail 
handling and prior to taking a break (e.g., for a meal or otherwise) or 
leaving work is a simple, yet effective way to reduce the possibility of 
transmitting microorganisms.

Some departments have begun to provide disposable gloves for use by those 
persons handling the mail. If gloves are used, please make sure to use 
them properly. Guidelines for proper glove use include:

- Putting on clean gloves immediately before handling the mail.

- Refraining from wearing gloves throughout the office.

- Keeping your hands away from your face (eyes, nose, mouth) while wearing 
gloves (e.g., wiping sweat away, brushing hair away from the face).

- Removing and disposing of the gloves as you complete your mail duties.
To take off gloves, pinch one glove at the base of one palm with the thumb 
and forefinger of the other hand and peel it off inside out. Slide the 
thumb of the bare hand under edge of the other glove, pinch the glove and 
peel it off. Both gloves will be inside out, with one contained within the 
other. The potentially contaminated surfaces of the gloves will be inside 
and the gloves will be ready for disposal. Place the gloves in a waste can 
having a plastic bag liner.

- Immediately after disposing of the gloves and PRIOR to starting other 
duties (e.g., answering the phone, making copies, etc.) wash your hands 
with soap and water.  

Wearing gloves does not replace the need for hand washing because gloves 
may have small, unapparent defects or may be torn during use, and hands 
can become contaminated during removal of gloves. For additional 
information or training on proper use of PPE (e.g., glove selection, use, 
removal, and disposal), please contact the Division of Environmental 
Health and Safety at 333-2755 or dehs@uiuc.edu.

To:      All Faculty, Academic Professionals, Civil Service Staff,
         Undergraduate Students, and Graduate Students

From:    Associate Vice Chancellor Van Anderson

Date:    October 18, 2001

Subject: In the Aftermath of September 11: A Safety and Security Update

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is committed to maintaining 
a welcoming environment that enables all members of the campus community to 
live and work in safety. In the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist 
attacks, a large number of campus personnel have been actively reviewing 
our programs and operations to identify possible changes that will enhance 
our safety and security. Some of the steps taken will be obvious, such as 
the new security protocols at Willard Airport and at Memorial Stadium, 
while other steps will be done out of the public view for security reasons.

We are fortunate to be able to draw on faculty and staff who are experts in 
the areas of terrorism, emergency response, safety, and security for these 
reviews. We are also fortunate to have strong ties to the local, state, and 
federal authorities, agencies, and professional associations that provide 
expert support and advice. I am providing a summary of some of our ongoing 
activities to give you an idea of the breadth of activities that are 
occurring.

Notification of Potential Threats

The University of Illinois Police Department (UIPD) maintains close contact 
with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI keeps all law 
enforcement agencies informed of potential threats across the United States 
and around the world. It is important to note that there are no known 
threats directed toward universities in the United States at this time. 
However, we must be vigilant. It is important to report to UIPD any unusual 
or suspicious activities so they can be properly investigated. 

Controlling Access to Facilities

When persons unknown to you enter your work areas, ask them if you can help 
them. This will allow you to determine if they should be in your area. Your 
security can be improved by remembering to lock your offices, labs, and 
residence hall rooms when you leave them and by not letting strangers into 
locked buildings for which they do not have a key. Persons with legitimate 
reasons for entering locked areas will either have a key or can ask for 
assistance from UIPD.

Services for Students

The Office of the Dean of Students, the Office of International Student 
Affairs, the Study Abroad Office, the Housing Division, and others have 
been monitoring student concerns regarding acts of revenge or intolerance. 
These offices have provided direct assistance to individual students and 
student groups. They have offered a wide variety of programs including 
information on safety and security issues. Students with concerns may call 
the Office of the Dean of Students at 333-0050 or contact 
helpdean@uiuc.edu. The Counseling Center, 333-3701, is also available to 
help students with stress-related issues.

The Study Abroad Office (SAO) has completed a comprehensive evaluation of 
its program to ensure that it continues to provide adequate travel safety, 
security, and health services to all students enrolled in the program. The 
SAO constantly monitors U.S. Department of State communications. Relevant 
information on safety matters is immediately conveyed to all study abroad 
students and their parents. If conditions in a foreign country warrant the 
U.S. Department of State recommending against travel to that country, any 
students in that country would be immediately recalled to the U.S. Since 
the September 11 terrorist attacks, no travel warnings have been issued for 
countries in which we have students studying abroad.

Review of Facilities

A comprehensive review of facilities is underway. Vulnerabilities are being 
assessed and changes implemented as needed. Some of our facilities are 
directly regulated by federal or state agencies that have jurisdiction to 
impose safety and security requirements. Willard Airport is one such 
facility. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has imposed new 
stringent security measures for all airports and Willard Airport continues 
to take the necessary steps to comply with the new requirements. Like the 
operation at Willard Airport, programs in other campus facilities with 
similar regulatory oversight maintain contact with the regulatory agencies 
to ensure that all prudent security measures are taken. 

Review of Research Safety and Security

The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research, the Office of the Vice 
Chancellor for Administration and Human Resources, a number of campus 
safety committees, the Division of Animal Resources (DAR), the Division of 
Environmental Health and Safety (DEHS), and the UIPD are working together 
and with individual researchers to address research safety. To assist 
researchers in the assessment of their laboratory safety and security 
needs, a document entitled ""Prudent Laboratory Safety and Security 
Practices"" was prepared and disseminated. That document can be viewed at 
http://www.ehs.uiuc.edu/lab.htm. Direct assistance in assessing safety and 
security needs can be provided by DAR (333-2564), DEHS (333-2755) and/or 
UIPD (333-1835).

Development of Advisory Documents

Another aspect of the ongoing efforts is the development of information and 
guidance documents relevant to possible threats. In response to the recent 
reports in the news of anthrax cases, the McKinley Health Center has 
created a web page that provides general information and answers to 
commonly asked questions about anthrax. The information can be viewed at 
http://www.mckinley.uiuc.edu/updates/anthrax.html. The U.S. Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Health Advisory last Friday 
evening containing guidelines for handling suspicious letters or packages 
that may contain anthrax. Those guidelines were modified for use on campus 
and distributed, along with U.S. Postal Service guidelines for handling 
potential mail bombs, to all faculty, staff, and students. That information 
can be viewed at http://www.vcadmin.uiuc.edu/mail.html.

Role of Individual Units

As you can see, a very comprehensive review of campus programs and 
operations is underway. It is important for all units to take time to 
review their unit safety and security plans, including emergency 
preparedness plans, to bring the plans up-to-date and to make sure the 
plans are understood by all members of the unit. This type of proactive 
response to safety and security will ensure that we can act quickly and 
decisively should an incident occur on campus. ",Safety and Security Update

Due to recent events involving anthrax, we understand that handling 
letters and packages is a concern for many faculty, staff, and students, 
especially those who deal with incoming mail. The U.S. Postal Service has 
provided guidelines for persons who receive a suspicious letter or 
package. Those guidelines are:

1) Handling with care, put the package down. Don?t shake or bump.
2) Don't open, smell, touch, or taste.
3) Isolate it immediately.
4) Treat it as suspect. Call 9-911 from campus phones, 911 from non-campus 
locations.

Re:     Campus Initiative on Aging Launched - Search for 
        Interested Faculty


In June 2001 the Colleges of Agricultural, Consumer and 
Environmental Sciences; Applied Life Studies; Liberal Arts and 
Sciences; Medicine; and Veterinary Medicine jointly committed to 
establishing a campus-wide Initiative on Aging with the goal of 
increasing collaborations in the area of aging research, 
education, and outreach. 

The Aging Initiative is designed to facilitate cutting edge 
research and discovery programs, effective learning experiences 
for students and relevant outreach efforts that engage policy 
makers, industry leaders and consumers.

Objectives of the initiative include:

     i.    Identify Faculty with Research Interests in Aging
     ii.   Organizing a campus-wide colloquium series on aging
     iii.  Facilitating interdisciplinary research proposals
     iv.   Providing seed money for especially promising proposals
     v.    Disseminating information about courses in the area of 
           aging
     vi.   Sponsoring an Annual Conference on Aging  
     vii.  Providing research support for faculty


We invite you to join the Aging Initiative Faculty:

One of the first goals for the Initiative is to compile a 
directory of researchers and scholars working in the area of 
aging.  If one of your areas of specialization is aging and you 
have published in the area of aging, you are invited to submit a 
brief biographical sketch (description of research interests; 5 
most relevant publications; research keywords; photo) for 
publication in the Initiative Directory and on the Initiative 
Website.

Bio Sketch Information:

    1.    Name
    2.    Position
    3.    Contact Information
    4.    Research Summary (one paragraph maximum 250 words)
    5.    Publications: (restricted to 5 most relevant articles)
    6.    List 5 keywords which summarize your research interests.
    7.    B/W or Color photo (jpg or bmp format). If you already 
          have a photo on your departmental website, you can simply 
          direct us to the appropriate url.


To view some sample bio sketches, please visit the initiative 
website at http://aging.als.uiuc.edu/faculty.htm

To all new freshmen and transfer students:

You may have heard about meningitis at Summer Orientation or on our web 
site at  www.mckinley.uiuc.edu

Meningococcal meningitis is an infection of the brain and its covering 
layers.  It may cause death or permanent disability.  College freshmen, 
especially those who live in residence halls, are at modestly increased 
risk for this infection.  There is an immunization available that affords 
substantial protection against this disease. 

We hope that you will never have to worry about meningitis.  However, if 
this is a concern for you and you have not already received this 
vaccination, it is available at McKinley at no additional charge.

Please consult our web pages at   www.mckinley.uiuc.edu/meningitis.html if 
you have any questions about the meningococcal vaccine.

As today's tragic events have continued to unfold and people from across 
campus have expressed the need for healing, a number of us have gathered 
to consider ways to mark these events, together, as a community.

This is a time when all of us feel vulnerable.  There will be members of 
our community who feel vulnerable because they may have lost loved ones.  
There will be members of our community who feel vulnerable because their 
hometowns have been the target of attacks.  There will be members of our 
community who feel vulnerable because they have come here from distant 
lands and may feel alone.  There will be members of our community who feel 
vulnerable because of their faith or cultural heritage.  It is critical 
during this time of deep emotion and empathy with the suffering of others 
that we reinforce our own ties of interdependence as a diverse community.

In light of all that I have heard from our campus community, I am asking 
the campus to observe tomorrow, Wednesday, as a day of conversation, 
reflection and engagement.  I urge faculty to use Wednesday's class time 
as an opportunity for reflection and discussion about today's tragic 
events.  Since some students will not feel comfortable attending class 
after these events, I have written faculty asking them not to penalize 
those who choose not to attend.

Reflection takes many forms.  Many members of the campus community will 
want to do something tangible to help.  This evening we will create a link 
on the home page to a page listing opportunities to volunteer their time, 
to donate blood and to make gifts to disaster relief.

That same page will list remembrance services in Champaign-Urbana this 
(Tuesday) evening.

On Thursday evening, the entire campus community is invited to gather at 7 
p.m. in Krannert's Great Hall for ""A Time for Remembrance and Unity.""  
This will be an occasion for people to come together to reflect and to 
forge unity.

I hope and believe that this is a community that will respond to tragedy 
by coming together.

At this year's meeting President James Stukel will formally introduce 
Chancellor Nancy Cantor to the faculty, and Drs. Stukel and Cantor will 
deliver remarks, after which there will be an open discussion session 
during which your questions and comments will be welcome.  They regard this 
meeting as an important occasion, and intend to use it to good effect.  
They will give you their sense of where we stand, what we are up against, 
and what is to be done; and they will be interested in hearing from you, 
both on the matters they mention and on others. 

The Annual Meeting of the Faculty can and should serve as a forum for a 
discussion of issues affecting all of us, to which both administrators and 
faculty contribute.  We hope that you will join us at this year's Meeting. 
 After its conclusion there will be a reception, sponsored by the

TO:     Faculty, staff, and students who conduct research

FROM:   Paul W. Bohn
        Interim Vice Chancellor for Research 


For compliance purposes, federal and state sponsors of research require 
that all faculty, staff, and students engaged in sponsored research be 
informed regularly about campus policies on research integrity.

The University-wide procedures for addressing particular instances of 
unethical conduct in research and publication are stated in the POLICY AND 
PROCEDURES ON ACADEMIC INTEGRITY IN RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION. This document 
is available on the Web at
   http://www.uiuc.edu/unit/vcres/ai/

Under this policy, all members of the University community are expected to 
observe high standards of academic integrity and ethical behavior in 
research and publication. Any practice or conduct by a member of the 
University community that seriously deviates from those ethical standards 
for proposing, conducting, and publishing research that are commonly 
accepted within the professional community constitutes academic misconduct 
in violation of University policy. 

Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to: 
   a. Fabrication or falsification of data, including intentionally 
misleading, selective, or deliberately false reporting of credentials or 
other academically related information; 


   b. Unacknowledged appropriation of the work of others, including 
plagiarism, the abuse of confidentiality with respect to unpublished 
materials, or misappropriation of physical materials; 


   c. Evasion of or intentional failure after notice by the University or 
federal, state, or another appropriate agency to comply with research 
regulations or requirements, including but not limited to those applying to 
human subjects, laboratory animals, new drugs, radioactive materials, 
genetically altered organisms, and to safety; and 


   d. Other conduct which seriously deviates from accepted ethical 
standards in scholarship. 
Differences of interpretation or judgment or honest error do not constitute 
academic misconduct. 
A student or faculty member who believes that academic misconduct has 
occurred has several options for pursuing the matter informally. Most such 
problems can and should be resolved without resort to formal procedures, 
through consultation with an adviser, department or unit head, or the 
campus Research Standards Officer, Gary Eden.

If you have questions about this policy, please contact Professor Eden or 
Dr. Melanie Loots at 333-0034 or rsofficer@uiuc.edu

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Office of Technology Management Backlog","Dear Colleagues,

	Technology transfer at UIUC is badly broken, and we are determined 
that it not remain so.  Thus, I am writing to report to you on the steps we 
are taking to create the effective, timely and successful technology 
transfer process that you and our students deserve.  

        First, it was critical to establish effective leadership.  We were 
fortunate to attract Michael Fritz, former president and CEO of the Carle 
Foundation and current chairman of the C-U Economic Development Corporation 
as Interim Director of our Office of Technology Management (OTM).  As we 
looked closely at intellectual property management at UIUC it was clear 
that we were a victim of our own success: hundreds of disclosures to OTM 
tell a story of productive, creative, energetic researchers with good 
ideas, many with direct commercial application and potential copyright and 
license opportunities.  However, because we did not manage IP effectively, 
the volume of unassessed technologies grew; the office became paralyzed; 
and many of you lost confidence.  Clearly, aggressive action was called 
for, both to eliminate the existing backlog and to implement a system to 
prevent this kind of bottlenecking from occurring again.  A two-pronged 
approach was devised.

	To address the backlog a team of graduate students, working in 
concert with Deloitte and Touche, has sorted and catalogued our 
technologies.  After reorganizing all the documentation and assembling 
marketing, patent and industry information, a first level screening of the 
potential commercial value was made for each invention.  It was then 
forwarded to a panel of industry experts, who then made a detailed 
assessment and recommendation for potential commercialization.  Now that 
the screening and priority-setting is finished, we will aggressively pursue 
those technologies that have significant commercial potential.  We will 
assess, market, and license the technologies or, when appropriate, 
facilitate faculty entrepreneurs in establishing start-up companies.  For 
technologies that have moderate potential value, we will pursue passive 
marketing strategies.  Importantly, we will communicate the status of each 
technology disclosure promptly to each inventor.  The initial phase of this 
work (assessment by industry experts) is complete, and I am pleased to 
report that there appears to be a great deal of value in our (your) 
intellectual property portfolio.

	The second effort is a full reorganization of the OTM, including 
significantly increased staff and other resources.  We will decentralize 
the work by placing professionals with expertise in technology 
commercialization and business development directly in the most active 
colleges and departments and supporting them with legal IP and business 
experts in a central office.  Additionally, OTM is developing connections 
to outside experts who will assist with evaluation and commercialization on 
an ongoing basis.  Our goal is to decentralize OTM in order to make it more 
accessible, efficient, accountable and service-oriented.

	Make no mistake.  Much work remains to achieve our goal of 
transforming the OTM into a premier IP management organization.  As we work 
toward that goal you can expect to remain fully informed of our progress, 
and we know we can count on you to let us know how we can do better.

                                Sincerely,
                                Paul W. Bohn

regular meeting at the Urbana-Champaign campus, and both are effective 
immediately. 
 
First, Chester S. ""Chet"" Gardner is the vice president for academic 
affairs, a position he has held on an acting basis since fall 1999, when he 
took over for Sylvia Manning, who went to the Chicago campus. He is a 
seasoned administrator who has served as vice chancellor for research, dean 
of the Graduate College, and acting dean of the College of Engineering, all 
at Urbana-Champaign. For more information about Dr. Gardner's appointment, 
see www.uillinois.edu/releases/gardnervp.html.

As a result of the enactment of the recent tax relief legislation, you may 
see a reduction in your payroll Federal tax withholding rates beginning 
July 1, 2001.  If you do not wish to take advantage of the new rates, you 
must file a new W-4 form.  You may file this form using NESSIE, the 
University's Web site for conducting personnel transactions, or by coming 
to the Payroll Office.  NESSIE is available at 
http://nessie.uihr.uillinois.edu/.  The Payroll Office is located in room 
100A of the Henry Administration Building.

The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act becomes effective 
July 1, 2001, and impacts all wages paid after June 30, 2001.  It lowers 
individual income tax rates, includes provisions to extend the income 
exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance, increases the basis 
for earned income credit beginning in 2002, and reduces the percent charged 
on supplemental wage payments.

The Act extends the income exclusion of $5,250 for employer-provided 
educational assistance to graduate level courses effective January 1, 2002.  
It also makes this income exclusion (for both undergraduate and graduate 
level courses) permanent.  In the past, this had been a temporary provision 
of the tax code.   Employees who take graduate level courses in the fall 
semester of the 2001-2002 academic year will still be taxed on the value of 
their fall tuition.  

If you have questions concerning the tax changes, please call the Payroll 
Office at 333-2443.

the core values of the campus and the overriding ethos of excellence.  She 
brings high energy, enthusiasm and appreciates the diversity of issues we 
address and the constituencies we serve.   

I want to take this opportunity to thank the Search committee, led by 
Professor Thomas Ulen, who brought Dr. Cantor's name to me.   Their 
dedicated, directed efforts resulted in nothing short of a superb list of 
final candidates.  

We will be having a campus/community reception for Dr. Cantor on Tuesday,

In our effort increase dialogue between students and the administration

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Contact with Potential Student Athletes","Questions and concerns have been raised recently about potential contacts 
by employees, students or others associated with the University with 
student athletes who are being recruited by the University of Illinois. As 
a member of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) and the 
Big Ten Athletic Conference, there are a number of rules with which all 
persons associated with the University must comply. For example, the NCAA 
regulates the timing, nature and frequency of contacts between any 
University employee and prospective athletes. It is the responsibility of 
the coaches and administration in the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics 
to recruit the best student athletes to participate in varsity sports at 
the University of Illinois. No contacts are permitted with prospective 
student athletes, including high school and junior college students, by 
University students, employees or others associated with the University 
without express authorization of the Director of Athletics or his designee. 

The University faces potentially serious sanctions for violation of NCAA or 
Big Ten rules. All members of the University community are expected to 
abide by these rules, and certainly any intentional violations will not be 
condoned. It is the responsibility of each member of the University to 
ensure that all students, employees and others associated with the 
University conduct themselves in a sportsmanlike manner. Questions about 
the rules should be addressed to Mr. Vince Ille, Assistant Director for 
Compliance, Bielfeldt Athletic Administration Building, 1700 S. Fourth 
Street, Champaign, IL 61820, (217) 333-5731, E-mail: ille@uiuc.edu.

Last November, the XtremeLearning technology based training program was 
introduced to faculty, staff, and students of the three University of 
Illinois campuses.  Since that time, thousands of University employees have 
accessed XtremeLearning training courses and taken advantage of the 
hundreds of offerings available for professional skills development, 
computer programming, and desktop applications.  XtremeLearning courses are 
available free of charge to University of Illinois faculty, students, and

Did you know XtremeLearning offers some of the most in-demand information 
technology courses, including Oracle, C Programming, C++, HTML, Cisco, 
Java, and Novell to name a few?  Many XtremeLearning courses have received 
approval from Microsoft and Oracle as ""Official Study Guides"" for 
certification exams.  For developing technical skills and preparing for 
certification, XtremeLearning is a no-cost option for increasing skills and 
gaining technical competencies.  

XtremeLearning also offers training in the desktop applications that many 
University employees use everyday, including Microsoft Word, Excel, Access, 
PowerPoint, and Project.  Additionally, XtremeLearning provides 
professional development courses to help you gain important skills in

Dear University of Illinois Colleagues:


We seek your help in identifying nominees for the position of Vice 
President for Academic Affairs. The VPAA position is among the most 
important administrative positions at the University of Illinois.  Dr. 
Sylvia Manning provided tremendous university leadership in this position 
before accepting the responsibilities of Chancellor at UIC.  The VPAA 
position is currently held by Dr. Chester Gardner, Vice President for 
Economic Development and Corporate Relations, on an interim basis. The 
position announcement has been placed in prominent national, regional and 
local publications intended to reach a diverse set of qualified potential 
candidates, and it is also at the bottom of this e-mail.


Our Search Committee is hard at work on the tremendously important task of
finding the next Vice President for Academic Affairs at the University of
Illinois.  We also have retained the services of Bill Funk of Korn Ferry
International, a very successful academic executive search firm, to help 
us. We already have a number of promising nominations and candidates.
Nevertheless, we would like to enlist your help in identifying nominees for
Vice President for Academic Affairs.  Please give careful thought to those
you know who might serve the University of Illinois in this important role.
If you would like to nominate someone, you may do so by writing to me by
e-mail (vpaasearch@uillinois.edu).


The Search Committee looks forward to hearing from you.

The University of Illinois invites nominations and applications for the
position of Vice President for Academic Affairs. 


The University of Illinois , an international
leader in higher education, includes three distinctive campuses with
combined student enrollments of 66,000.  The campuses at Chicago (25,000
students) and Urbana-Champaign (37,000 students) are classified as
Doctoral/Research Universities - Extensive.  The newest campus, located in
the State capital of Springfield (4,000 students) is classified as a
Master's Comprehensive University I.


The Vice President for Academic Affairs is the senior academic officer of
the University and reports directly to the President. The Vice President 
for Academic Affairs advises the President on matters of educational 
policy, academic programs, academic personnel actions, and capital and 
operating budget development.  The Vice President is responsible for the 
overall coordination of planning and budgeting at the University and 
represents the interests of the University to the Illinois Board of Higher 
Education on matters pertaining to academic programs and priorities.  Among 
other duties, the Vice President exercises direct line authority over 
certain University-wide units and programs, including the Institute of 
Government and Public Affairs, the University Office for Academic Policy 
Analysis, the University of Illinois Press, UI Online, the President's 
Leadership Program, and the University Office of Outreach and Public 
Service. 


Progressively responsible administrative experience with academic policies,
personnel, and budgets is required for the position.  An earned doctorate 
or equivalent and a record of teaching and scholarship that would merit
appointment as a tenured professor at the University of Illinois are
required.  The ability to understand and work effectively in a complex
academic culture influenced by multiple campuses, a land-grant university
tradition and a medical school, is also required.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Job Well Done","Dear Colleagues:

An emergency on Friday at our power plant meant that most campus buildings 
lost power and heat.  Now that service has been largely restored, let us 
recognize and take pride in the dedication and sense of community displayed 
so consistently across campus in the face of this problem.  

The crews that battled the fire and its aftermath in Abbott Power Plant—
including individuals from O&M and Illinois Power, as well as community 
firefighters—deserve our thanks and our commendation.  The situation was 
dangerous and unpredictable, to which all of these individuals responded at 
the highest level.  Our thanks to all who contributed to the fast and 
comprehensive restoration of services.

While O&M was working to contain the fire and restore services, hundreds of 
people across campus swung into action to begin implementing contingency 
plans to minimize further consequences.   

Participants in our telephone alert system quickly and competently spread 
the word about the cancellation of classes and started emergency responses 
across campus.  Staff in Student Affairs and Housing assessed the situations 
in dorms that were affected and began preparing plans for assuring the 
safety, housing and continuation of services to our students.  Research 
staff took actions to assure safety and to protect experiments and 
equipment.  Despite failures in first-level emergency backup systems, CCSO 
staff restored electronic communications and minimized the effects of the 
power outage on sensitive equipment.  And, across campus, people kept 
working with flashlights and coats on, answering phones, providing 
information, and generally doing whatever it took to keep necessary 
operations going.  The staffers at the DI put out a special edition under 
adverse circumstances, and students across campus responded with calm and 
good will.

So to all those who helped cope with this emergency, and especially to the 
individuals in Operations and Maintenance who labored throughout the day and 
evening to return the campus to its normal state, we wish to express our 
considerable appreciation for a job well done. We hope the rest of the 
semester is calm and productive for all.

The Athletic Board serves as an advisory committee to the Chancellor and

J. Fred Giertz (2002)
William D. O’Brien, Jr. (2003)
Matthew Wheeler (2004)
Joyce C. Wright (2002)

At the February 12, 2001, Senate meeting, the Committee on Committees will 
present a slate of four faculty nominees.  Upon Senate approval of the 
slate, the Chancellor will appoint two of these nominees for these 
positions.

We invite you to make nominations; faculty may also self-nominate.

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Research Integrity Policies","For compliance purposes, federal and state sponsors of research require 
that all faculty, staff, and students engaged in sponsored research be 
informed regularly about campus policies on research integrity.

The University-wide procedures for addressing particular instances of 
unethical conduct in research and publication are stated in the POLICY AND 
PROCEDURES ON ACADEMIC INTEGRITY IN RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION.  This 
document is available on the Web at http://www.uiuc.edu/unit/vcres/ai/.

Under this policy, all members of the University community are expected to 
observe high standards of academic integrity and ethical behavior in 
research and publication.  Any practice or conduct by a member of the 
University community that seriously deviates from those ethical standards 
for proposing, conducting, and publishing research that are commonly 
accepted within the professional community constitutes academic misconduct 
in violation of University policy. 

Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to:

a. Fabrication or falsification of data, including reporting of credentials 
or other academically related information that is intentionally misleading, 
selective, or deliberately false;
 
b. Unacknowledged appropriation of the work of others, including 
plagiarism, the abuse of confidentiality with respect to unpublished 
materials, or misappropriation of physical materials;
 
c. Intentional failure to comply with research regulations or requirements, 
including but not limited to those applying to human subjects, laboratory 
animals, new drugs, radioactive materials, genetically altered organisms, 
and to safety; and 

d. Other conduct that seriously deviates from accepted ethical standards in 
scholarship.  Differences of interpretation or judgment or honest error do 
not constitute academic misconduct.

A student or faculty member who believes that academic misconduct has

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Homecoming and Fan Behavior","To:   Faculty, Staff and Students

From:  Chancellor Michael Aiken

	The following letter is being printed this week in the Daily Illini 
and the News-Gazette, and I am also sending it by email today to the campus 
community.


To the Campus Community, Alumni and Other Illini Fans:

	The week of October 8-15, 2000, is Homecoming week.  We were one of 
the first, if not the first, universities to celebrate Homecoming.  
Therefore, I want to encourage all members of our community to participate 
in Homecoming activities, including attendance at the football game with 
Iowa on Saturday.

Home football weekends on the Urbana-Champaign campus are usually  
characterized by an atmosphere of spirited competition and friendly 
rivalry.  And, certainly the vast majority of those who participate in 
events on football weekends do so in a positive, courteous and responsible 
manner.  I'm greatly concerned, however, by circumstances that developed on 
our campus and in the campustown area at the time of our last home football 
game.  There were, unfortunately, several incidents - before, during and 
after the game - in which some Illinois fans were much less than courteous 
to the Michigan fans, including the booing of the Michigan band.  Such 
behavior is inappropriate, and it damages the reputation of the University.

	When a team comes to our campus for an athletic competition, the 
visiting team, band and fans are our guests, and they should be treated 
courteously and with respect.  Anything less is inconsistent with the 
standards of a world class university.  Good natured kidding and ""ribbing"" 
are to be expected, but actions such as heckling, cursing, obscene slogans, 
and spitting upon and throwing objects at the team, band and fans from 
another university are inappropriate.

	All of us want to be supportive of Coach Turner and our football 
team, and we wish them all the best as the season continues.  However, we 
dishonor their efforts and their sportsmanship if we indulge in rude and 
insulting behavior toward our guests.

	During the week of  Homecoming, I encourage the members of our 
campus community, our alumni and other loyal Illini fans to participate in 
the Homecoming activities and traditions on our campus.  I also ask that 
all Illini fans treat our Iowa guests with courtesy and respect.

						Michael Aiken

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Call for Critical Research Initiative Preproposals","Dear Fellow Faculty:

I am issuing a call for preproposals for the Critical Research Initiative 
(CRI) program.  The CRI program is entering its seventh year of 
competition.  The purpose of the CRI program is to facilitate formation of 
collaborations and exploration of innovative ideas that will open new 
directions and enhance the intellectual environment of the campus and/or 
lead to long term support from external sources.  The CRI program also 
supports research initiatives not yet ready for external funding or areas 
where there is presently little prospect for funding, but initiatives that 
would improve the intellectual life on campus.  Novel interdisciplinary 
approaches and emergent programs are especially appropriate candidates to 
request support from the CRI program, although funding will not be 
restricted to such projects.

Preproposals are due Monday, October 23, 2000.  The preproposal can be up 
to three pages in length and describe the concept of the proposal.  It is 
important to consider the Review Criteria for the preproposal (see website) 
during the preparation of the preproposal.  After preproposals are reviewed 
by a faculty committee, authors of the top preproposals will be notified 
and asked to prepare a proposal for further consideration.  For further 
details of the CRI program, see .  Questions 
should be addressed to Janice Bahr, Associate Vice Chancellor for Research.

regard this meeting as an important occasion, and intend to use it to good

against, and what is to be done; and they will be interested in hearing 
from you, both on the matters they mention and on others. 

The Annual Meeting of the Faculty can and should serve as a forum for a 
discussion of issues affecting all of us, to which both administrators and 
faculty contribute.  We hope that you will join us at this year's Meeting. 
After its conclusion there will be a reception, sponsored by the

to participate this spring in a faculty seminar, as part of the Preparing 
Future Professors project.
This project is supported by the Provost's Initiative on 
Teaching Advancement, and is consistent with the national Preparing 
Future Faculty program. 
Participants will be provided with a small honorarium as well as 
weekly materials and coffee. The seminar will meet on Thursdays from 
8:30 to 10:30 a.m., January 27 through April 20, 2000, in Grainger 
Library.
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is committed to 
preparing graduate students for both academic and nonacademic 
careers. This spring seminar will help participants develop 
departmental programs that better serve graduate students and postdocs in 
preparation for careers as college and university professors. Seminar 
topics will include motivation and cognition strategies, mentoring, 
teaching portfolios, and ethics in teaching.
Potential participants should contact my graduate assistant, Carol 
Mills, by e-mail to c-mills@uiuc.edu. Additional information about 
the Preparing Future Professors Project is on the Web at 
http://www.grad.uiuc.edu/pfp/projectdesc.html
We in the Graduate College are pleased to work with you to make our 
campus the best place for graduate education possible. 
We appreciate your support of the Preparing Future Professors project.

While there are relatively few viruses anticipated to be a problem
for Y2K, this is a good time to review your virus protection and safe
computing practices.  When is the last time you backed up your computer
to CD-ROM or tape?  Are all your important files stored in at least
three different places?  Are you running the latest Anti-Virus software
available from UIUC?  If you use Microsoft Products like Internet Explorer
5, Office/Word, or Outlook/Exchange have you applied the patches provided
by Microsoft to correct numerous security flaws in those applications?

Anti-Virus software:
CCSO has licensed all the NAI (Network Associates, Inc.) Anti-Virus
software for most common platforms in use on campus.   These can all be
downloaded from the main distribution URL at:

https://www-s.uiuc.edu/sitelic/dist

Microsoft Windows Updates:
Windows 98 and Windows 2000 users:
Please start the Windows Update service from your Start menu.
Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 users:
Install or use Internet Explorer 5 in order to run Windows Update.

Please see http://www.uiuc.edu/sitelic/sitedoc/nai/y2kvirus.html
for additional instructions, tips, and many useful references.

Best wishes for safe and happy holidays!

 Subject: MASSMAIL - Annual Message on Research Integrity Policies","ANNUAL MESSAGE ON RESEARCH INTEGRITY POLICIES

TO:		All Faculty 

FROM:	Tony G. Waldrop
		Interim Vice Chancellor for Research and
		Interim Dean of the Graduate College


NOTE:  Please bring this message also to the attention of all staff and 
students who may be working with you on research.

Federal and state sponsors of research require all faculty, staff, and 
students engaged in sponsored research be informed regularly about campus 
policies on research integrity.

The University-wide procedures for addressing particular instances of 
unethical conduct in research and publication are stated in the POLICY AND 
PROCEDURES ON ACADEMIC INTEGRITY IN RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION.  This 
document is available on the Web at  http://www.uiuc.edu/unit/vcres/ai/  
Under this policy, all members of the University community are expected to 
observe high standards of academic integrity and ethical behavior in 
research and publication.  Any practice or conduct by a member of the 
University community that seriously deviates from commonly accepted ethical 
standards within the professional community for proposing, conducting, and 
publishing research constitutes academic misconduct in violation of 
University policy.

Academic misconduct, as defined in the University Policy includes, but is 
not limited to:
a.  Fabrication or falsification of data, including intentionally 
misleading, selective, or deliberately false reporting of credentials or 
other academically related information; 
b.  Unacknowledged appropriation of the work of others, including 
plagiarism, the abuse of confidentiality with respect to unpublished 
materials, or misappropriation of physical materials;
c.  Evasion of or intentional failure after notice by the University or 
federal, state or another appropriate agency to comply with research 
regulations or requirements, including but not limited to those applying to 
human subjects, laboratory animals, new drugs, radioactive materials, 
genetically altered organisms, and to safety; and
d.  Other conduct which seriously deviates from accepted ethical standards 
in scholarship.
Differences of interpretation or judgment or honest error do not constitute 
academic misconduct.

A student, staff or faculty member who believes that academic misconduct 
has occurred has several options for pursuing the matter informally.  Most 
such problems can and should be resolved without resort to formal 
procedures.  Such resolution occurs through consultation with an adviser, 
department or unit head, or the campus Research Standards Officer, Michael 
Loui, Associate Dean of the Graduate College.

If you have questions about this policy, please contact Dean Loui at 
333-6715 or 
m-loui@uiuc.edu
In addition to the previously mentioned POLICY AND PROCEDURES ON ACADEMIC 
INTEGRITY IN RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION (http://www.uiuc.edu/unit/vcres/ai/), 
I would like to bring your attention to the following official campus 
statement on ""Responsible Professional Conduct:  Guidelines for Teaching, 
Research, and Service.""  This statement is printed in the ACADEMIC STAFF 
HANDBOOK (1998-2000), pp. 62-65, and available on the Web at  
http://webster.uihr.uiuc.edu/ahrhandbook/chap5/academic_integrity.html

The statement is also printed in the HANDBOOK FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS AND 
ADVISORS (January 1999), pp. 48-50, and available on the Web at
